Given the ending '-o', it is likely a thematic noun in -o, possibly a genitive singular form. 'αδαμας' is a name, so 'a-da-ma-o' is classified as an anthroponym (personal name), a noun, and thematic in -o."
a-da-me-we,0,0,2,0.9,"The word 'a-da-me-we' has Greek cognates 'αδαμεfεις' and 'αδαμευς', which are personal names. The lexicon also indicates it's a personal name.

a-da-ra-te-ja,0,0,1,0.9,"The word 'a-da-ra-te-ja' has the Greek cognate 'αδραστεια', which Chadwick & Ventris suggest is a feminine anthroponym. The Linear B word ends in '-ja', corresponding to the '-εια' ending in the Greek cognate. This ending is consistent with a thematic noun in -a."
a-da-ra-ti-jo,0,0,0,0.95,"The word 'a-da-ra-ti-jo' has the Greek cognate 'αδραστιος', which is a personal name (anthroponym).

Considering these cognates, it is likely a common noun. The ending '-pi' could be an instrumental/locative suffix, so we consider 'a-di-ri-ja'. The cognates suggest a connection to 'ανηρ' (man), which is an athematic noun. Therefore, I classify it as a common noun with athematic inflection."
a-di-ri-ja-te,5,2,1,0.9,"The word 'a-di-ri-ja-te' has the cognate 'ανδριαντει'. The Linear B word ends in '-te', which is an ablative suffix and should be ignored. The remaining part 'a-di-ri-ja' corresponds to the Greek word 'ανδριας' (statue, image of a man). The cognate 'ανδριαντει' is the dative plural of 'ανδριας', meaning 'for/to statues'. Therefore, 'a-di-ri-ja' is likely an adjective in the dative plural form, describing something related to statues or images of men. Since it's an adjective, it's classified as part_of_speech 2. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic inflection in -a."
a-di-ri-jo,0,0,2,0.9,"The word 'a-di-ri-jo' has Greek cognates 'ανδριος' and 'ανηρ'. 'ανηρ' means 'man', and 'ανδριος' is an adjective derived from it, meaning 'manly' or 'belonging to a man'. The Linear B word likely represents a personal name or a name derived from the concept of 'man'. The ending '-jo' doesn't directly correspond to a thematic -o declension. However, considering the cognate 'ανηρ', which is an athematic noun, and the possibility of the Linear B word being a derivative or a related form, it's more likely to be an athematic noun. The -jo ending could be a modified genitive or another case form. Therefore, I classify it as an anthroponym (0), a noun (0), and athematic (2)."
a-du,5,0,2,0.9,"The word 'a-du' has the cognate 'αδυ'. The word 'αδυ' means 'sweet' or 'pleasant'. It is an athematic noun, as it does not follow the thematic -o or -a declensions.

de-ko-to,0,0,2,0.9,"The word 'de-ko-to' has the cognate 'δεκτος', which Chadwick & Ventris suggest could be an anthroponym. The lexicon also indicates it could be an anthroponym. Given the lack of a clear thematic -o or -a ending and the possibility of it being an anthroponym, I classify it as an athematic noun (inflection 2). The ending -to is not a standard thematic ending, supporting the athematic classification. The cognate δέκτος is an adjective, but in this case, it is used as a name, so it is a noun."
de-ko-to-jo,5,2,0,0.9,"The word 'de-ko-to-jo' has the cognate 'δεκτος', which means 'acceptable, received'. This suggests that 'de-ko-to-jo' is an adjective. The ending '-jo' is similar to the genitive singular of thematic nouns and adjectives in -o, but given the cognate, it is more likely to be an adjective in the genitive singular.

The cognate 'δεμεοντες' suggests a plural form related to building. The word is likely a noun referring to 'they who build'. The ending '-o-te' is not a standard thematic ending. Considering the cognate and the meaning, it's more likely an athematic noun, possibly a plural form. The suffix -τες is typical of athematic nouns."
de-mi-ni-a,5,0,1,0.95,"The word 'de-mi-ni-a' has the cognate 'δεμνια', which means 'bed clothes'. This suggests it is a common noun. The ending '-a' suggests that it is a thematic noun in -a."

de-so-mo,5,0,2,0.95,"The word 'de-so-mo' has the Greek cognates 'δεσμοις' (desmois, dative plural) and 'δεσμος' (desmos, nominative singular). The lexicon entries suggest '(with) straps' or 'band bond'. The word is a common noun. The cognate 'δεσμος' suggests an athematic noun, as thematic nouns in -o would have a nominative singular ending in -os in ancient greek, while athematic nouns can have variable endings. The Linear B word 'de-so-mo' likely corresponds to the dative plural 'δεσμοις' or genitive singular 'δεσμου' (desmou) of the athematic noun 'δεσμος'."

di,2,0,2,0.95,"The word 'di' has the cognate 'Διος/Ζευς' (Zeus). 'Διος' is the genitive/dative form of Zeus. Since it's a deity name, the word type is theonym. The ending suggests an athematic inflection, as the dative singular of athematic nouns can end in -i or -e."
di-da-ka,1,0,1,0.9,"The word 'di-da-ka' has the cognate 'διδασκω' (didasko), which means 'I teach'. However, the Linear B word ends in '-ka', which could be related to a noun form. Given the context of administrative records, it's more likely to be a noun related to teaching or instruction. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun in -a. It could be related to 'didache' (teaching), which is a noun. Since the word is used in administrative context, it is more likely to be an animal name. The ending -a suggests a thematic noun in -a."
di-da-ka-re,5,0,2,0.85,"The word 'di-da-ka-re' has cognates 'διδασκαλει' and 'διδασκαλος'. 'διδασκαλει' is a locative form, and 'διδασκαλος' means 'teacher' or 'schoolmaster'.

However, given the cognate 'διδασκαλει', which is a locative form, and the lexicon entries suggesting 'at the schoolmaster's', it's plausible that 'di-da-ka-re' is an athematic locative form. Therefore, it's classified as a common noun with athematic inflection."
di-do,5,1,-1,0.95,"The word 'di-do' has Greek cognates 'διδους|διδοω|διδωμι', all of which are related to the verb 'to give'. The Linear B word likely represents a verb form. Since it's a verb, the inflection is -1."

di-ka,5,0,2,0.85,"The word 'di-ka' has two possible cognates: 'δικη' (dike) meaning 'justice, law, custom, order' and 'διχα' (dikha) meaning 'in two, asunder, separately'. 'δικη' is an athematic noun, and 'διχα' is an adverb. Given the lack of a clear thematic ending and the possibility of an athematic noun cognate, I classify 'di-ka' as a common noun with athematic inflection. The 'a' ending is compatible with the accusative or nominative neuter athematic declension."
di-ka-ta-de,3,0,2,0.9,"The word 'di-ka-ta-de' is identified as a toponym (place name) based on the lexicon entry 'place name (mountain)'.

do-ra,5,0,1,0.95,"The word 'do-ra' has the Greek cognate 'δωρα' (dora), which means 'gifts'. The Linear B word likely represents the same meaning. The ending '-a' suggests it is a thematic noun in -a, likely a plural form."

'e-ni' has the cognate 'ενι', which Chadwick & Ventris interpret as 'and there is (are) among them' cf. ἔνεστί τε ἔνι. This suggests that 'e-ni' is a verb form.

Given the cognates and the -te ending, which is not an ablative suffix in this case, the word is most likely a participle or verbal adjective. The cognate 'ιοντες' (going) is a participle. The ending -te suggests a thematic adjective in -o, as the -te could be a syllabic representation of a consonant followed by -o. Therefore, it is classified as an adjective (participle) with thematic inflection in -o."

o-ha,5,3,-1,0.7,"The word 'o-ha' has the cognate 'οhα', which is described in the lexicon as an introductory/prothetic word meaning 'who, in this manner'. This suggests it functions as an adverb. Since it's an adverb, the inflection is not applicable."

pi-ro-na,5,0,2,0.85,"The word 'pi-ro-na' has the cognate 'πρων', which means 'promontory, headland'. This suggests that 'pi-ro-na' is a common noun. The ending '-na' does not fit the thematic declensions in -o or -a. Therefore, it is likely an athematic noun. The ancient greek cognate is an athematic noun."
pi-ro-we-ko,0,0,0,0.9,"The word 'pi-ro-we-ko' has the cognate 'φιλοfεργος', which is a compound adjective meaning 'fond of work'. However, the lexicon entry indicates it's a personal name. Given the -o ending, it's likely a thematic noun in -o, used as an anthroponym."
pi-sa-wa-ta,0,0,1,0.95,"The word 'pi-sa-wa-ta' has the cognate 'πισfατας', which suggests it is an anthroponym (personal name). The ending '-a' suggests that it is a thematic noun in -a."
pi-ta-ke-u,0,0,2,0.9,"The word 'pi-ta-ke-u' has the Greek cognate 'πιτακευς' (pitakeus). The lexicon entries also indicate it's a personal name (anthroponym). The ending '-u' suggests an athematic noun inflection, similar to 'a-ke-re-u' (agreus) and 'ka-ke-u' (khalkeus)."
pi-ti-ryo-we-sa,5,2,1,0.9,"The word 'pi-ti-ryo-we-sa' has the cognates 'πτιλιοfεσσα' and 'πτιλον'. The lexicon entry suggests 'furnished with feathers? (πτίλον= feather)'. The ending '-sa' suggests that it is an adjective, specifically a thematic adjective in -a, describing something furnished with feathers. Therefore, it is classified as a common word (5), adjective (2), and thematic in -a (1)."
po-da,5,0,2,0.9,"The word 'po-da' has cognates 'ποδα', 'πους', and 'σπονδη'. 'πους' means 'foot' and 'σπονδη' means 'libation'. Given the lexicon entry 'libation', and the cognate 'σπονδη', it is likely a common noun. The ending '-da' does not directly correspond to a thematic inflection. However, considering the cognate 'σπονδη', which is an athematic noun, and the fact that Linear B is syllabic, the '-da' could be a syllabic representation of an athematic noun ending. Therefore, I classify it as athematic."
po-da-ko,1,0,0,0.9,"The word 'po-da-ko' has the Greek cognate 'ποδαργος', which means 'swift-footed' and is used as an epithet for animals, particularly oxen and horses. The Linear B word likely refers to an animal name. The ending '-o' suggests a thematic noun in -o."
po-da-ko-qe,0,2,0,0.9,"The word 'po-da-ko-qe' has the cognate 'ποδαργος', which means 'swift-footed'. Removing the suffix '-qe', we have 'po-da-ko', which corresponds to an adjective. The ending '-o' suggests a thematic adjective in -o. Therefore, it is classified as an adjective (part_of_speech = 2) with thematic inflection in -o (inflection = 0). It describes a characteristic, so it can be used as an anthroponym."
po-de,5,0,2,0.9,"The word 'po-de' has cognates ποδει, πους, ποφι. The cognates suggest a connection to 'foot' or 'with feet'. The ending '-de' is not a suffix to ignore. The cognates 'πους' (pous) is an athematic noun meaning 'foot'. The Linear B word 'po-de' likely represents a dative singular form (ποδει) or a plural form. Given the athematic nature of the cognate, and the lack of thematic endings, I classify 'po-de' as an athematic noun."
po-i-ti-jo,0,0,0,0.95,"The word 'po-i-ti-jo' has the Greek cognate 'φοιτευς'. The lexicon entry 'Chadwick & Ventris 1973: anthroponym' confirms that it is an anthroponym (person name). The Linear B word ends in '-jo', which corresponds to the genitive singular of thematic nouns in -o (e.g., '-ojo' becomes '-jo' due to syllabic writing). However, the cognate φοιτευς is athematic. The Linear B word is likely a thematic version of the athematic name, or a derivative. Given the -o ending, it is classified as a thematic noun in -o."
po-ka,5,0,1,0.95,"The word 'po-ka' has the cognate 'ποκος' (pokos), which means 'fleeces'. The Linear B word likely represents the plural form of the noun. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun in -a (plural form). Therefore, it is a common noun with inflection class 1."
po-ke-we,0,0,2,0.95,"The word 'po-ke-we' has the cognate 'φωκευς' (phokeus), which means 'Phocian' or 'seal hunter'. Chadwick & Ventris identify it as an anthroponym in the dative case. The ending '-we' corresponds to the athematic dative singular ending '-e/-i' (the 'w' is just a consonant that can be part of the syllable). Therefore, it's an anthroponym (person name), a noun, and athematic."
po-ki-ro,5,2,0,0.95,"The word 'po-ki-ro' has the cognate 'ποικιλος' (poikilos), which means 'variegated, dappled, intricate'. This is an adjective, and the ending '-o' suggests a thematic inflection in -o, similar to thematic nouns and adjectives."
po-ki-ro-nu-ka,5,2,0,0.9,"The word 'po-ki-ro-nu-ka' has cognates 'ποικιλονυχα' and 'ποικιλωνυχα', which mean 'with varied nails'. This suggests it is an adjective describing something with varied nails. The ending '-ka' can be interpreted as a thematic adjective ending in -o (neuter plural) or -a (feminine singular). Given the meaning and the cognates, it is most likely an adjective. Therefore, part_of_speech is 2 (adjective) and inflection is 0 (thematic in -o, considering it could be a neuter plural form). Word type is 5 (common)."
po-ku-ta,0,0,0,0.9,"The word 'po-ku-ta' has the Greek cognate 'ποκυτης'. The lexicon entries suggest it's an occupational term or related to livestock breeding. Given the cognate ending in -ης, and the Linear B word ending in -ta, it is likely a thematic noun in -a (masculine form), referring to a person. Therefore, it's classified as an anthroponym (person name), a noun, and thematic in -a."
po-ku-te-ro,5,2,0,0.95,"The word 'po-ku-te-ro' has the cognate 'ποκυτερος', which suggests it is an adjective. The ending '-o' indicates a thematic adjective in -o. The lexicon entry also supports this classification, stating it's an adjective related to 'po-ku-ta'."
po-me,5,0,2,0.95,"The word 'po-me' translates to 'shepherd'. The cognates ποιμενει, ποιμενος, and ποιμην suggest that it is related to the word for shepherd. The Linear B word 'po-me' likely corresponds to a form of the Greek word ποιμην (shepherd). The absence of a clear thematic vowel (-o or -a) and the cognates' athematic declension patterns (especially ποιμενος, genitive) strongly suggest an athematic inflection. Therefore, it is classified as a common noun with athematic inflection."
po-me-ne,5,0,2,0.95,"The word 'po-me-ne' has the cognates 'ποιμην' and 'ποιμενει', both related to 'shepherd'. The Linear B word likely represents a form of the noun 'shepherd'. The ending '-ne' suggests an athematic inflection, as thematic nouns typically end in -o or -a in the nominative singular. The cognate ποιμην (nominative) and ποιμενει (dative) confirm that it is an athematic noun. Therefore, it is classified as a common noun with athematic inflection."
po-me-no,5,0,0,0.95,"The word 'po-me-no' has the cognate 'ποιμενος' (poimenos), meaning 'shepherd'. This indicates it's a common noun. The Linear B word ends in '-o', suggesting a thematic noun in -o, aligning with the second declension in Ancient Greek. The genitive form of the cognate is 'ποιμενος', which further supports the classification as a thematic noun in -o, as the genitive of thematic nouns in -o often ends in -ojo in Linear B (corresponding to -ου in later Greek)."
po-ni-ke,5,2,0,0.85,"The word 'po-ni-ke' has the cognate 'φοινικει', which suggests it is an adjective related to 'phoenix' or 'palm tree'. The Linear B word ends in '-ke', which can be interpreted as a thematic adjective ending in -o (masculine/neuter nominative singular) if we consider that the final -e is the result of the syllabic writing system. Therefore, it's classified as a common adjective with thematic inflection in -o."
po-ni-ke-a,5,0,1,0.9,"The word 'po-ni-ke-a' has the cognate 'φοινικια', which likely refers to 'Phoenician things' or 'dates' (the fruit). The ending '-a' suggests it is a thematic noun in -a. Therefore, it is classified as a common noun with inflection class 1."
po-ni-ke-ja,5,0,1,0.9,"The word 'po-ni-ke-ja' has cognates 'φοινικια' and 'φοινικιος'. 'φοινικια' can be a feminine noun or a neuter plural noun, while 'φοινικιος' is an adjective. The lexicon entries suggest 'cnmson'. Given the -ja ending, it is likely a thematic noun in -a, possibly an adjective used as a noun. The Chadwick & Ventris entry suggests it is an anthroponym in the dative case, appearing as 'o-pi po-ni-ke-ja'. However, the Tselentis lexicon suggests 'cnmson', which is an adjective. Considering the cognates and the possible dative form, I classify it as a common noun (or adjective used as a noun) in the dative case, thematic in -a."
po-ni-ke-qe,5,0,2,0.9,"The word is 'po-ni-ke-qe'. Removing the suffix '-qe', we have 'po-ni-ke'. The cognate is 'φοινιξ' (phoenix). This is a common noun referring to the phoenix bird.

po-pi,-1,-1,-1,0.2,"The provided information is insufficient to confidently classify 'po-pi'. The lexicon entry 'with legs' is vague and doesn't provide enough context.

po-pu-re-ja,5,0,1,0.95,"The word 'po-pu-re-ja' has the Greek cognate 'πορφυρεια', which means 'purple' and is a feminine noun.

po-pu-ryo,0,0,2,0.9,"The word 'po-pu-ryo' has the cognate 'πορφυριων', which is a personal name (anthroponym).

po-qa,5,0,1,0.9,"The word 'po-qa' has the cognate 'φορβη', which means 'grazing feed'. This suggests that 'po-qa' is a common noun. The ending '-a' suggests that it is a thematic noun in -a."

po-re-na,5,2,1,0.95,"The word 'po-re-na' has cognates 'φερομαι' and 'φορηναι'. 'φερομαι' means 'to be brought', and 'φορηναι' is the infinitive form.

po-ro,1,0,0,0.95,"The word 'po-ro' has two possible cognates: 'πωλος' (foal) and 'πωρος' (porous stone). The lexicon entries support both meanings. However, given the administrative context of Linear B, 'foal' (young horse) is more likely than 'porous stone'. The word ends in '-o', suggesting a thematic noun in -o.

po-ro-du-ma-te,5,2,0,0.9,"The word 'po-ro-du-ma-te' has the cognate 'προδυματες'. The Linear B word ends in '-te', which is a suffix that can be ignored. Therefore, we consider 'po-ro-du-ma'. The cognate 'προδυματες' suggests a connection to 'προθυμος' (prothumos), meaning 'willing, eager'. The ending '-os' suggests an adjective. The Linear B word 'po-ro-du-ma' can be interpreted as an adjective. The ending '-ma' suggests a thematic adjective in -o (neuter plural or accusative singular).

po-so-re-ja,5,0,1,0.7,"The word 'po-so-re-ja' has two possible cognates: 'ψωρεια' (psoreia) and 'καπνος' (kapnos). 'ψωρεια' refers to a skin disease, while 'καπνος' means smoke. The lexicon entry 'smoke' from Chadwick-Ventris supports the 'καπνος' cognate. However, the ending '-ja' suggests a thematic noun in -a, which is not consistent with 'καπνος' (thematic in -o). The Tselentis lexicon suggests a personal name, but without further evidence, I will classify it as a common noun, possibly related to a skin condition or smoke, and inflected as a thematic noun in -a, based on the ending. The cognate 'ψωρεια' is more likely, and it is a thematic noun in -a."

Therefore, the word is a theonym (deity name), a noun, and has a thematic inflection in -a, as the base word 'po-ti-ni-ja' (Potnia) is thematic in -a. The final -a is likely a case ending, possibly nominative/accusative plural or genitive singular, but the dative plural -i is more likely given the cognate."
po-ti-ni-ja-we,2,0,1,0.95,"The word 'po-ti-ni-ja-we' has the cognate 'ποτνια'. 'ποτνια' means 'mistress, lady, female deity title'.

The ending '-ko' doesn't clearly indicate thematic or athematic declension. However, considering the cognate 'ρακος', which is an athematic noun in ancient greek, and the fact that the Linear B syllabary often simplifies endings, it's more likely that 'ra-ko' represents an athematic noun.

ti-mi-to-a-ke-e,3,0,0,0.7,"The word 'ti-mi-to-a-ke-e' has cognates like 'θεμιστωναγος' and 'θεμιτοςαγος'. The lexicon suggests 'holy place of themis/themistes' or 'grove of the terebinth trees'.

The ending '-e-e' is not a standard inflectional ending, but the core word seems to be related to a place associated with Themis or terebinth trees. Considering the cognates and lexicon entry, it is likely a thematic noun in -o, with the final -e-e being a possible locative or other case ending. The word is thus classified as a toponym (3), noun (0), and thematic in -o (0)."
ti-mi-to-a-ke-i,3,0,0,0.85,"The word 'ti-mi-to-a-ke-i' has cognates that suggest it refers to a place associated with Themis or terebinth trees.

The 'ti-mi-to' part is likely related to Themis, and 'a-ke-i' to a grove. Therefore, it's classified as a toponym (place name). The ending '-i' is not a standard inflectional ending, so we consider the base form 'ti-mi-to-a-ke' which can be considered a thematic noun in -o, as the cognates suggest a place name. The ending -o is a common thematic ending."

The -e ending could be a dative singular athematic ending. However, without more context, it's difficult to be certain.

e-ro-e,0,0,1,0.7,"The lexicon suggests 'e-ro-e' could be an anthroponym, possibly a genitive form. The ending '-e' could correspond to the thematic -a declension (genitive singular -ao becoming -o in Linear B, and then simplified to -e).

The ending -me is part of the -me-na/-me-no suffix for participles, and since the full form would be something like -me-na, it is classified as thematic in -a."
