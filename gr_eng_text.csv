1,1,4,"ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:

πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,","Tell me, O Muse, of the man of many devices, who wandered full many ways after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, aye, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea,"
1,5,9,"ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.

Yet even so he saved not his comrades, though he desired it sore, for through their own blind folly they perished—fools, who devoured the kine of Helios Hyperion; but he took from them the day of their returning."
1,10,14,"τῶν ἁμόθεν γε,  θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.

Now all the rest, as many as had escaped sheer destruction, were at home, safe from both war and sea, but Odysseus alone, filled with longing for his return and for his wife, did the queenly nymph Calypso, that bright goddess,"
1,15,19,"ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι,  λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.
ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,

But when, as the seasons revolved, the year came in which the gods had ordained that he should return home to Ithaca, not even there was he free from toils, even among his own folk. And all the gods pitied him"
1,20,24,"νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν

Howbeit Poseidon had gone among the far-off Ethiopians—the Ethiopians who dwell sundered in twain, the farthermost of men, some where Hyperion sets and some where he rises,"
1,25,29,"ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.

“Look you now, how ready mortals are to blame the gods. It is from us, they say, that evils come, but they even of themselves, through their own blind folly, have sorrows beyond that which is ordained."
1,35,39,"ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο

1,40,43,"ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο,

So Hermes spoke, but for all his good intent he prevailed not upon the heart of Aegisthus; and now he has paid the full price of all.”"

Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth?"

Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Therefore of a truth, stranger, will I frankly tell thee all."

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Surely, then, no nameless lineage have the gods appointed for thee in time to come, seeing that Penelope bore thee such as thou art. But come, tell me this and declare it truly."
1,225,229,"τίς δαίς,  τίς δὲ ὅμιλος ὅδ᾽ ἔπλετο; τίπτε δέ σε χρεώ;

Then would the whole host of the Achaeans have made him a tomb,"

But as it is, the spirits of the storm have swept him away and left no tidings: he is gone out of sight, out of hearing, and for me he has left anguish and weeping; nor do I in any wise mourn and wail for him alone, seeing that the gods have brought upon me other sore troubles."
1,245,249,"ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι,

Then, stirred to anger, Pallas Athena spoke to him:“Out on it! Thou hast of a truth sore need of Odysseus that is gone, that he might put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers."

But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought."
1,380,384,"νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες
Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευεν.
τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός:
Τηλέμαχ᾽, ἦ μάλα δή σε διδάσκουσιν θεοὶ αὐτοὶ","Without atonement, then, should ye perish within my halls.”
So he spoke, and they all bit their lips and marvelled at Telemachus, for that he spoke boldly.
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him:“Telemachus, verily the gods themselves are teaching thee"
1,385,389,"ὑψαγόρην τ᾽ ἔμεναι καὶ θαρσαλέως ἀγορεύειν:
μὴ σέ γ᾽ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλῆα Κρονίων

τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
Ἀντίνο᾽, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω;","to be a man of vaunting tongue, and to speak with boldness. May the son of Cronos never make thee king in sea-girt Ithaca, which thing is by birth thy heritage.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Antinous, wilt thou be wroth with me for the word that I shall say?"
1,390,394,"καὶ κεν τοῦτ᾽ ἐθέλοιμι Διός γε διδόντος ἀρέσθαι.
ἦ φῂς τοῦτο κάκιστον ἐν ἀνθρώποισι τετύχθαι;
οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακὸν βασιλευέμεν: αἶψά τέ οἱ δῶ

ἀλλ᾽ ἦ τοι βασιλῆες Ἀχαιῶν εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι","Even this should I be glad to accept from the hand of Zeus. Thinkest thou indeed that this is the worst fate among men? Nay, it is no bad thing to be a king. Straightway one's house grows rich and oneself is held in greater honor. However, there are other kings of the Achaeans"
1,395,399,"πολλοὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ,  νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί,

τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα:","full many in seagirt Ithaca, both young and old. One of these haply may have this place, since goodly Odysseus is dead. But I will be lord of our own house and of the slaves that goodly Odysseus won for me.”
Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him:"
1,400,404,"Τηλέμαχ᾽,  ἦ τοι ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται,
ὅς τις ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλεύσει Ἀχαιῶν:

Never may that man come who by violence and against thy will shall wrest thy possessions from thee, while men yet live in Ithaca."
1,405,409,"ἀλλ᾽ ἐθέλω σε,  φέριστε, περὶ ξείνοιο ἐρέσθαι,

Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Does he bring some tidings of thy father's coming, or came he hither in furtherance of some matter of his own?"
1,410,414,"οἷον ἀναΐξας ἄφαρ οἴχεται,  οὐδ᾽ ὑπέμεινε

Εὐρύμαχ᾽, ἦ τοι νόστος ἀπώλετο πατρὸς ἐμοῖο:
οὔτ᾽ οὖν ἀγγελίῃ ἔτι πείθομαι, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι,","How he started up, and was straightway gone! Nor did he wait to be known; and yet he seemed no base man to look upon.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus, surely my father's home-coming is lost and gone. No longer do I put trust in tidings, whencesoever they may come,"
1,415,419,"οὔτε θεοπροπίης ἐμπάζομαι,  ἥν τινα μήτηρ

But this stranger is a friend of my father's house from Taphos. He declares that he is Mentes, son of wise Anchialus, and he is lord over the oar-loving Taphians.”
"
1,420,420,"ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, φρεσὶ δ᾽ ἀθανάτην θεὸν ἔγνω.","So spoke Telemachus, but in his heart he knew the immortal goddess."
1,421,424,"οἱ δ᾽ εἰς ὀρχηστύν τε καὶ ἱμερόεσσαν ἀοιδὴν

Now the wooers turned to the dance and to gladsome song, and made them merry, and waited till evening should come; and as they made merry dark evening came upon them. Then they went, each man to his house, to take their rest."
1,425,429,"Τηλέμαχος δ᾽,  ὅθι οἱ θάλαμος περικαλλέος αὐλῆς

She it was who bore for Telemachus the blazing torches;"

But he sat down in his father's seat, and the elders gave place.

Three others there were; one, Eurynomus, consorted with the wooers, and two ever kept their father's farm. Yet, even so, he could not forget that other, mourning and sorrowing; and weeping for him he addressed the assembly, and spoke among them:

Never have we held assembly or session since the day when goodly Odysseus departed in the hollow ships. And now who has called us together? On whom has such need come either of the young men or of those who are older?"

So he took his stand in the midst of the assembly, and the staff was placed in his hands by the herald Peisenor, wise in counsel."
2,39,39,πρῶτον ἔπειτα γέροντα καθαπτόμενος προσέειπεν:,"Then he spoke, addressing first the old man:

2,129,129,τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:,"
Then wise Telemachus answered him, and said:"
2,130,134,"Ἀντίνο᾽,  οὔ πως ἔστι δόμων ἀέκουσαν ἀπῶσαι

An evil thing it were for me to pay back a great price to Icarius, as I must, if of my own will I send my mother away. For from her father's hand shall I suffer evil, and heaven"

Therefore will I never speak this word. And for you, if your own heart is wroth here at, get you forth from my halls and prepare you other feasts,"
2,140,144,"ὑμὰ κτήματ᾽ ἔδοντες ἀμειβόμενοι κατὰ οἴκους.

But if this seems in your eyes to be a better and more profitable thing, that one man's livelihood should be ruined without atonement, waste ye it. But I will call upon the gods that are forever, if haply Zeus may grant that deeds of requital may be wrought."
2,145,149,"νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε.

So spoke Telemachus, and in answer Zeus, whose voice is borne afar, sent forth two eagles, flying from on high, from a mountain peak. For a time they flew swift as the blasts of the wind side by side with wings outspread;"
2,150,154,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ μέσσην ἀγορὴν πολύφημον ἱκέσθην,

Then they tore with their talons one another's cheeks and necks on either side, and darted away to the right across the houses and the city of the men."
2,155,159,"θάμβησαν δ᾽ ὄρνιθας,  ἐπεὶ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν:

Then among them spoke the old lord Halitherses, son of Mastor, for he surpassed all men of his day in knowledge of birds and in uttering words of fate."
2,160,164,"ὅ σφιν ἐὺ φρονέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε:

“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say; and to the wooers especially do I declare and announce these things, since on them a great woe is rolling. For Odysseus shall not long be away from his friends, but even now, methinks,"
2,165,169,"ἐγγὺς ἐὼν τοῖσδεσσι φόνον καὶ κῆρα φυτεύει

Aye, and to many others of us also who dwell in clear-seen Ithaca will he be a bane. But long ere that let us take thought how we may make an end of this—or rather let them of themselves make an end, for this is straightway the better course for them."
2,170,174,"οὐ γὰρ ἀπείρητος μαντεύομαι,  ἀλλ᾽ ἐὺ εἰδώς:

For unto Odysseus I declare that all things are fulfilled even as I told him, when the Argives embarked for Ilios and with them went Odysseus of many wiles. I declared that after suffering many ills and losing all his comrades he would come home in the twentieth year"

Then Eurymachus, son of Polybus, answered him, and said: “Old man, up now, get thee home and prophesy to thy children, lest haply in days to come they suffer ill."

Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Eurymachus and all ye other lordly wooers,"

To him, on departing with his ships, Odysseus had given all his house in charge, that it should obey the old man and that he should keep all things safe.

Then Leocritus, son of Euenor, answered him:“Mentor, thou mischief-maker, thou wanderer in thy wits, what hast thou said, bidding men make us cease? Nay, it were a hard thing"

So he spoke, and hastily broke up the assembly. They then scattered, each one to his own house; and the wooers went to the house of divine Odysseus.

2,265,266,"ἔρχεσθαι: τὰ δὲ πάντα διατρίβουσιν Ἀχαιοί,

So spoke Athena, daughter of Zeus, nor did Telemachus tarry long after he had heard the voice of the goddess, but went his way to the house, his heart heavy within him. He found there the proud wooers in the halls,"

ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην μετ᾽ ἀγαυοῦ πατρὸς ἀκουήν.","Nay, I bid thee, eat and drink even as before. All these things the Achaeans will surely provide for thee—the ship and chosen oarsmen—that with speed thou mayest go to sacred Pylos to seek for tidings of thy noble father.”"
2,309,309,τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:,"
Then wise Telemachus answered him:"
2,310,314,"Ἀντίνο᾽,  οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑπερφιάλοισι μεθ᾽ ὑμῖν
δαίνυσθαί τ᾽ ἀκέοντα καὶ εὐφραίνεσθαι ἕκηλον.
ἦ οὐχ ἅλις ὡς τὸ πάροιθεν ἐκείρετε πολλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὰ
κτήματ᾽ ἐμά, μνηστῆρες, ἐγὼ δ᾽ ἔτι νήπιος ἦα;
νῦν δ᾽ ὅτε δὴ μέγας εἰμὶ καὶ ἄλλων μῦθον ἀκούων","“Antinous, in no wise is it possible for me in your overweening company to sit at meat quietly and to make merry with an easy mind. Is it not enough, ye wooers, that in time past ye wasted many goodly possessions of mine, while I was still a child? But now that I am grown,"
2,315,319,"πυνθάνομαι,  καὶ δή μοι ἀέξεται ἔνδοθι θυμός,
πειρήσω, ὥς κ᾽ ὔμμι κακὰς ἐπὶ κῆρας ἰήλω,
ἠὲ Πύλονδ᾽ ἐλθών, ἢ αὐτοῦ τῷδ᾽ ἐνὶ δήμῳ.
εἶμι μέν, οὐδ᾽ ἁλίη ὁδὸς ἔσσεται ἣν ἀγορεύω,
ἔμπορος: οὐ γὰρ νηὸς ἐπήβολος οὐδ᾽ ἐρετάων","and gain knowledge by hearing the words of others, yea and my spirit waxes within me, I will try how I may hurl forth upon your evil fates, either going to Pylos or here in this land. For go I will, nor shall the journey be in vain whereof I speak, though I voyage in another's ship, since I may not be master of ship or oarsmen."
2,320,324,"γίγνομαι: ὥς νύ που ὔμμιν ἐείσατο κέρδιον εἶναι.
ἦ ῥα, καὶ ἐκ χειρὸς χεῖρα σπάσατ᾽ Ἀντινόοιο
ῥεῖα: μνηστῆρες δὲ δόμον κάτα δαῖτα πένοντο.
οἱ δ᾽ ἐπελώβευον καὶ ἐκερτόμεον ἐπέεσσιν.
ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:","So, I ween, it seemed to you to be more to your profit.”
He spoke, and snatched his hand from the hand of Antinous without more ado, and the wooers were busy with the feast throughout the hall. They mocked and jeered at him in their talk; and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
"
2,325,329,"ἦ μάλα Τηλέμαχος φόνον ἡμῖν μερμηρίζει.
ἤ τινας ἐκ Πύλου ἄξει ἀμύντορας ἠμαθόεντος
ἢ ὅ γε καὶ Σπάρτηθεν, ἐπεί νύ περ ἵεται αἰνῶς:
ἠὲ καὶ εἰς Ἐφύρην ἐθέλει, πίειραν ἄρουραν,
ἐλθεῖν, ὄφρ᾽ ἔνθεν θυμοφθόρα φάρμακ᾽ ἐνείκῃ,","“Aye, verily Telemachus is planning our murder. He will bring men to aid him from sandy Pylos or even from Sparta, so terribly is he set upon it. Or he means to go to Ephyre, that rich land, to bring from thence deadly drugs,"
2,330,334,"ἐν δὲ βάλῃ κρητῆρι καὶ ἡμέας πάντας ὀλέσσῃ.
ἄλλος δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:
τίς δ᾽ οἶδ᾽, εἴ κε καὶ αὐτὸς ἰὼν κοίλης ἐπὶ νηὸς
τῆλε φίλων ἀπόληται ἀλώμενος ὥς περ Ὀδυσσεύς;
οὕτω κεν καὶ μᾶλλον ὀφέλλειεν πόνον ἄμμιν:","that he may cast them in the wine-bowl, and destroy us all.”
And again another of the proud youths would say: “Who knows but he himself as he goes on the hollow ship may perish wandering far from his friends, even as Odysseus did? So would he cause us yet more labour;"
2,335,339,"κτήματα γάρ κεν πάντα δασαίμεθα,  οἰκία δ᾽ αὖτε
τούτου μητέρι δοῖμεν ἔχειν ἠδ᾽ ὅς τις ὀπυίοι.
ὣς φάν, ὁ δ᾽ ὑψόροφον θάλαμον κατεβήσετο πατρὸς
εὐρύν, ὅθι νητὸς χρυσὸς καὶ χαλκὸς ἔκειτο
ἐσθής τ᾽ ἐν χηλοῖσιν ἅλις τ᾽ ἐυῶδες ἔλαιον:","for we should have to divide all his possessions, and his house we should give to his mother to possess, and to him who should wed her.”
So they spoke, but Telemachus went down to the high-roofed treasure-chamber of his father, a wide room where gold and bronze lay piled, and raiment in chests, and stores of fragrant oil."
2,340,344,"ἐν δὲ πίθοι οἴνοιο παλαιοῦ ἡδυπότοιο
ἕστασαν, ἄκρητον θεῖον ποτὸν ἐντὸς ἔχοντες,
ἑξείης ποτὶ τοῖχον ἀρηρότες, εἴ ποτ᾽ Ὀδυσσεὺς

κληισταὶ δ᾽ ἔπεσαν σανίδες πυκινῶς ἀραρυῖαι,","There, too, stood great jars of wine, old and sweet, holding within them an unmixed divine drink, and ranged in order along the wall, if ever Odysseus should return home even after many grievous toils. Shut were"
2,345,349,"δικλίδες: ἐν δὲ γυνὴ ταμίη νύκτας τε καὶ ἦμαρ

τὴν τότε Τηλέμαχος προσέφη θαλαμόνδε καλέσσας:
μαῖ᾽, ἄγε δή μοι οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσον","the double doors, close-fitted; and there both night and day a stewardess abode, who guarded all in wisdom of mind, Eurycleia, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor. To her now Telemachus, when he had called her to the treasure-chamber, spoke, and said:
“Nurse, draw me off wine in jars,"
2,350,354,"ἡδύν,  ὅτις μετὰ τὸν λαρώτατος ὃν σὺ φυλάσσεις

Fill twelve jars and fit them all with covers, and pour me barley meal into well-sewn skins,"
2,355,359,"εἴκοσι δ᾽ ἔστω μέτρα μυληφάτου ἀλφίτου ἀκτῆς.
αὐτὴ δ᾽ οἴη ἴσθι: τὰ δ᾽ ἁθρόα πάντα τετύχθω:

εἶμι γὰρ ἐς Σπάρτην τε καὶ ἐς Πύλον ἠμαθόεντα","and let there be twenty measures of ground barley meal. But keep knowledge hereof to thyself, and have all these things brought together; for at evening I will fetch them, when my mother goes to her upper chamber and bethinks her of her rest. For I am going to Sparta and to sandy Pylos"
2,360,360,"νόστον πευσόμενος πατρὸς φίλου,  ἤν που ἀκούσω.","to seek tidings of the return of my dear father, if haply I may hear any.”"
2,361,364,"ὣς φάτο, κώκυσεν δὲ φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια,

τίπτε δέ τοι, φίλε τέκνον, ἐνὶ φρεσὶ τοῦτο νόημα
ἔπλετο; πῇ δ᾽ ἐθέλεις ἰέναι πολλὴν ἐπὶ γαῖαν","
So he spoke, and the dear nurse, Eurycleia, uttered a shrill cry, and weeping spoke to him winged words:“Ah, dear child, how has this thought come into thy mind? Whither art thou minded to go over the wide earth,"
2,365,369,"μοῦνος ἐὼν ἀγαπητός;  ὁ δ᾽ ὤλετο τηλόθι πάτρης

ἀλλὰ μέν᾽ αὖθ᾽ ἐπὶ σοῖσι καθήμενος: οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ","thou who art an only son and well-beloved? But he hath perished far from his country, the Zeus-born Odysseus, in a strange land; and these men, so soon as thou art gone, will devise evil for thee hereafter, that thou mayest perish by guile, and themselves divide all these possessions. Nay, abide here in charge of what is thine; thou hast no need"
2,370,374,"πόντον ἐπ᾽ ἀτρύγετον κακὰ πάσχειν οὐδ᾽ ἀλάλησθαι.
τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
θάρσει, μαῖ᾽, ἐπεὶ οὔ τοι ἄνευ θεοῦ ἥδε γε βουλή.
ἀλλ᾽ ὄμοσον μὴ μητρὶ φίλῃ τάδε μυθήσασθαι,
πρίν γ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἂν ἑνδεκάτη τε δυωδεκάτη τε γένηται,","to suffer ills and go a wanderer over the unresting sea.”
Then wise Telemachus answered her: “Take heart, nurse, for not without a god's warrant is this my plan. But swear to tell naught of this to my dear mother until the eleventh or twelfth day shall come,"
2,375,379,"ἢ αὐτὴν ποθέσαι καὶ ἀφορμηθέντος ἀκοῦσαι,

αὐτίκ᾽ ἔπειτά οἱ οἶνον ἐν ἀμφιφορεῦσιν ἄφυσσεν,","or until she shall herself miss me and hear that I am gone, that she may not mar her fair flesh with weeping.”
So he spoke, and the old woman swore a great oath by the gods to say naught. But when she had sworn and made an end of the oath, straightway she drew for him wine in jars,"
2,380,384,"ἐν δέ οἱ ἄλφιτα χεῦεν ἐϋρραφέεσσι δοροῖσι.

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. In the likeness of Telemachus she went everywhere throughout the city, and to each of the men she drew near and spoke her word,"
2,385,387,"ἑσπερίους δ᾽ ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν ἀγέρεσθαι ἀνώγει.

Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. She went her way to the house of divine Odysseus,"
2,395,399,"ἔνθα μνηστήρεσσιν ἐπὶ γλυκὺν ὕπνον ἔχευε,

But they rose to go to their rest throughout the city, and remained no long time seated, for sleep was falling upon their eyelids. But to Telemachus spoke flashing-eyed Athena,"
2,400,404,"ἐκπροκαλεσσαμένη μεγάρων ἐὺ ναιεταόντων,

“Telemachus, already thy well-greaved comrades sit at the oar and await thy setting out. Come, let us go, that we may not long delay their journey.”

Now when they had come down to the ship and to the sea, they found on the shore their long-haired comrades, and the strong and mighty Telemachus spoke among them:

ὥς τέ μοι ἀθάνατος ἰνδάλλεται εἰσοράασθαι.
ὦ Νέστορ Νηληϊάδη, σὺ δ᾽ ἀληθὲς ἐνίσπες:
πῶς ἔθαν᾽ Ἀτρεΐδης εὐρὺ κρείων Ἀγαμέμνων;
ποῦ Μενέλαος ἔην; τίνα δ᾽ αὐτῷ μήσατ᾽ ὄλεθρον","for thrice, men say, has he been king for a generation of men, and like unto an immortal he seems to me to look upon. Nestor, son of Neleus, do thou tell me truly: how was the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, slain? Where was Menelaus? What death did"
3,250,254,"Αἴγισθος δολόμητις,  ἐπεὶ κτάνε πολλὸν ἀρείω;
ἦ οὐκ Ἄργεος ἦεν Ἀχαιικοῦ, ἀλλά πῃ ἄλλῃ

τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, τέκνον, ἀληθέα πάντ᾽ ἀγορεύσω.","guileful Aegisthus plan for the king, since he slew a man mightier far than himself? Was Menelaus not in Achaean Argos, but wandering elsewhere among men, so that Aegisthus took heart and did the murderous deed?”
Then the horseman, Nestor of Gerenia, answered him: “Then verily, my child, will I tell thee all the truth."
3,255,259,"ἦ τοι μὲν τάδε καὐτὸς ὀίεαι,  ὥς κεν ἐτύχθη,

ἀλλ᾽ ἄρα τόν γε κύνες τε καὶ οἰωνοὶ κατέδαψαν","Lo, of thine own self thou dost guess how this matter would have fallen out, if the son of Atreus, fair-haired Menelaus, on his return from Troy had found Aegisthus in his halls alive. Then for him not even in death would they have piled the up-piled earth, but the dogs and birds would have torn him"
3,260,264,"κείμενον ἐν πεδίῳ ἑκὰς ἄστεος,  οὐδέ κέ τίς μιν

We on our part abode there in Troy fulfilling our many toils; but he, at ease in a nook of horse-pasturing Argos, ever sought to beguile with words the wife of Agamemnon."
3,265,269,"ἡ δ᾽ ἦ τοι τὸ πρὶν μὲν ἀναίνετο ἔργον ἀεικὲς

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δή μιν μοῖρα θεῶν ἐπέδησε δαμῆναι,","Now at the first she put from her the unseemly deed, the beautiful Clytemnestra, for she had an understanding heart; and with her was furthermore a minstrel whom the son of Atreus straitly charged, when he set forth for the land of Troy, to guard his wife. But when at length the doom of the gods bound her that she should be overcome,"
3,270,274,"δὴ τότε τὸν μὲν ἀοιδὸν ἄγων ἐς νῆσον ἐρήμην

And many thigh-pieces he burned upon the holy altars of the gods, and many offerings he hung up, woven stuffs and gold,"
3,275,275,"ἐκτελέσας μέγα ἔργον,  ὃ οὔ ποτε ἔλπετο θυμῷ.",since he had accomplished a mighty deed beyond all his heart had hoped.
3,276,279,"ἡμεῖς μὲν γὰρ ἅμα πλέομεν Τροίηθεν ἰόντες,

So he spoke, and the sun set, and darkness came on."

So spoke the daughter of Zeus, and they hearkenened to her voice. Heralds poured water over their hands, and youths filled the bowls brim full of drink,"

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him: “Well indeed hast thou spoken in this, old friend, and it were fitting for Telemachus to hearken to thee, since it is far better thus. But while he shall now follow with thee, that he may sleep"

So spoke the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, and she departed in the likeness of a sea-eagle; and amazement fell upon all at the sight, and the old man marvelled, when his eyes beheld it. And he grasped the hand of Telemachus, and spoke, and addressed him:

“So I spoke, and he straightway made answer, and said: ‘Son of Atreus, why dost thou question me of this? In no wise does it behove thee to know, or to learn my mind; nor, methinks, wilt thou long be free from tears, when thou hast heard all aright."

So he spoke, and they all praised his words, and bade him act. And straightway they rose up and went to the house of Odysseus."
4,675,679,"οὐδ᾽ ἄρα Πηνελόπεια πολὺν χρόνον ἦεν ἄπυστος

So he went through the hall to bear the tidings to Penelope;"
4,680,684,"τὸν δὲ κατ᾽ οὐδοῦ βάντα προσηύδα Πηνελόπεια:

“Herald, why have the lordly wooers sent thee forth? Was it to tell the handmaids of divine Odysseus to cease from their tasks, and make ready a feast for them? Never wooing any more, nor consorting together elsewhere,"
4,685,689,"ὕστατα καὶ πύματα νῦν ἐνθάδε δειπνήσειαν:

Surely ye hearkened not at all in olden days, when ye were children, when your fathers told what manner of man Odysseus was among them that begat you,"
4,690,694,"οὔτε τινὰ ῥέξας ἐξαίσιον οὔτε τι εἰπὼν

4,695,699,"φαίνεται,  οὐδέ τίς ἐστι χάρις μετόπισθ᾽ ἐυεργέων.

Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I would, O queen, that this were the greatest evil. But another greater far and more grievous are the wooers planning, which I pray that the son of Cronos may never bring to pass."
4,700,704,"Τηλέμαχον μεμάασι κατακτάμεν ὀξέι χαλκῷ

So he spoke, and her knees were loosened where she sat, and her heart melted. Long time she was speechless, and both her eyes"

“Herald, why is my son gone? He had no need to go on board swift-faring ships, which serve men as horses of the deep, and cross over the wide waters of the sea."
4,710,714,"ἦ ἵνα μηδ᾽ ὄνομ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἐν ἀνθρώποισι λίπηται;

Then Medon, wise of heart, answered her: “I know not whether some god impelled him, or whether his own heart was moved to go to Pylos, that he might learn either of his father's return or what fate he had met.”"
4,715,719,"ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας ἀπέβη κατὰ δῶμ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος.

4,720,724,"πᾶσαι,  ὅσαι κατὰ δώματ᾽ ἔσαν νέαι ἠδὲ παλαιαί.

Then the good nurse Eurycleia answered her:“Dear lady, thou mayest verily slay me with the pitiless sword or let me abide in the house, yet will I not hide my word from thee."
4,745,749,"ᾔδε᾽ ἐγὼ τάδε πάντα,  πόρον δέ οἱ ὅσσ᾽ ἐκέλευε,

But he took from me a mighty oath not to tell thee until at least the twelfth day should come, or thou shouldst thyself miss him and hear that he was gone, that thou mightest not mar thy fair flesh with weeping."

4,758,759,"ὣς φάτο, τῆς δ᾽ εὔνησε γόον, σχέθε δ᾽ ὄσσε γόοιο.
ἡ δ᾽ ὑδρηναμένη, καθαρὰ χροῒ εἵμαθ᾽ ἑλοῦσα","
So she spoke, and lulled Penelope's laments, and made her eyes to cease from weeping. She then bathed, and took clean raiment for her body,"
4,760,764,"εἰς ὑπερῷ᾽ ἀνέβαινε σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξίν,

“Hear me, child of Zeus who bears the aegis, unwearied one. If ever Odysseus, of many wiles, burnt to thee in his halls fat thigh-pieces of heifer or ewe,"
4,765,769,"τῶν νῦν μοι μνῆσαι,  καί μοι φίλον υἷα σάωσον,

ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:","remember these things now, I pray thee, and save my dear son, and ward off from him the wooers in their evil insolence.”
So saying she raised the sacred cry, and the goddess heard her prayer. But the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
"
4,770,774,"ἦ μάλα δὴ γάμον ἄμμι πολυμνήστη βασίλεια

So would one of them speak; but they knew not how these things were to be. And Antinous addressed their company, and said:
“Good sirs, shun haughty speech"
4,775,779,"πάντας ὁμῶς,  μή πού τις ἀπαγγείλῃσι καὶ εἴσω.

So he spoke, and chose twenty men that were best, and they went their way to the swift ship and the shore of the sea."
4,780,784,"νῆα μὲν οὖν πάμπρωτον ἁλὸς βένθοσδε ἔρυσσαν,

But she, the wise Penelope, lay there in her upper chamber, touching no food, tasting neither meat nor drink, pondering whether her peerless son would escape death,"
4,790,794,"ἦ ὅ γ᾽ ὑπὸ μνηστῆρσιν ὑπερφιάλοισι δαμείη.

And even as a lion is seized with fear and broods amid a throng of men, when they draw their crafty ring about him, so was she pondering when sweet sleep came upon her. And she sank back and slept, and all her joints relaxed."
4,795,799,"ἔνθ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἄλλ᾽ ἐνόησε θεά,  γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:

She made a phantom, and likened it in form to a woman, Iphthime, daughter of great-hearted Icarius, whom Eumelus wedded, whose home was in Pherae. And she sent it to the house of divine Odysseus,"

“Sleepest thou, Penelope, thy heart sore stricken?"
4,805,809,"οὐ μέν σ᾽ οὐδὲ ἐῶσι θεοὶ ῥεῖα ζώοντες

Then wise Penelope answered her, as she slumbered very sweetly at the gates of dreams:"

Then the dim phantom answered her, and said:"

So saying the phantom glided away by the bolt of the door into the breath of the winds. And"

He verily abides in an island suffering grievous pains, in the halls of the nymph Calypso, who"
5,15,19,"ἴσχει: ὁ δ᾽ οὐ δύναται ἣν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι:
οὐ γάρ οἱ πάρα νῆες ἐπήρετμοι καὶ ἑταῖροι,

And now again they are minded to slay his well-loved son on his homeward way; for he went in quest of tidings of his father"
5,20,24,"ἐς Πύλον ἠγαθέην ἠδ᾽ ἐς Λακεδαίμονα δῖαν.

οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή,
ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών;","to sacred Pylos and to goodly Lacedaemon.”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Didst thou not thyself devise this plan, that verily Odysseus might take vengeance on these men at his coming?"
5,25,29,"Τηλέμαχον δὲ σὺ πέμψον ἐπισταμένως,  δύνασαι γάρ,

He spoke, and said to Hermes, his dear son:“Hermes, do thou now, seeing that thou art at other times our messenger,"
5,30,34,"νύμφῃ ἐυπλοκάμῳ εἰπεῖν νημερτέα βουλήν,

5,35,39,"Φαιήκων ἐς γαῖαν,  οἳ ἀγχίθεοι γεγάασιν,

These shall heartily shew him all honor, as if he were a god, and shall send him in a ship to his dear native land, after giving him stores of bronze and gold and raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy,"
5,40,44,"εἴ περ ἀπήμων ἦλθε,  λαχὼν ἀπὸ ληίδος αἶσαν.

So he spoke, and the messenger, Argeiphontes, failed not to hearken. Straightway he bound beneath his feet his beautiful sandals,"
5,45,49,"ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια,  τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφ᾽ ὑγρὴν

“Why, pray, Hermes of the golden wand, hast thou come, an honorable guest and welcome? heretofore thou hast not been wont to come. Speak what is in thy mind; my heart bids me fulfil it,"
5,90,91,"εἰ δύναμαι τελέσαι γε καὶ εἰ τετελεσμένον ἐστίν.

So saying, the goddess set before him a table laden with ambrosia, and mixed the ruddy nectar. So he drank and ate, the messenger Argeiphontes."

So he spoke, and Calypso, the beautiful goddess, shuddered, and she spoke, and addressed him with winged words: “Cruel are ye, O ye gods, and quick to envy above all others, seeing that ye begrudge goddesses that they should mate with men"

οὕτω δὴ οἶκόνδε φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν","So they put forth their hands to the good cheer lying ready before them. But when they had their fill of food and drink, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, was the first to speak, and said:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,"
5,205,209,"αὐτίκα νῦν ἐθέλεις ἰέναι;  σὺ δὲ χαῖρε καὶ ἔμπης.
εἴ γε μὲν εἰδείης σῇσι φρεσὶν ὅσσα τοι αἶσα
κήδε᾽ ἀναπλῆσαι, πρὶν πατρίδα γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι,
ἐνθάδε κ᾽ αὖθι μένων σὺν ἐμοὶ τόδε δῶμα φυλάσσοις
ἀθάνατός τ᾽ εἴης, ἱμειρόμενός περ ἰδέσθαι","would'st thou then fare now forthwith home to thy dear native land! Yet, even so fare thee well. Howbeit if in thy heart thou knewest all the measure of woe it is thy fate to fulfil before thou comest to thy native land thou wouldest abide here and keep this house with me, and wouldest be immortal, for all thy desire to see"
5,210,214,"σὴν ἄλοχον,  τῆς τ᾽ αἰὲν ἐέλδεαι ἤματα πάντα.
οὐ μέν θην κείνης γε χερείων εὔχομαι εἶναι,
οὐ δέμας οὐδὲ φυήν, ἐπεὶ οὔ πως οὐδὲ ἔοικεν
θνητὰς ἀθανάτῃσι δέμας καὶ εἶδος ἐρίζειν.
τὴν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:","thy wife for whom thou longest day by day. Surely not inferior to her do I declare myself to be either in form or stature, for in no wise is it seemly that mortal women should vie with immortals in form or comeliness.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:"
5,215,219,"πότνα θεά,  μή μοι τόδε χώεο: οἶδα καὶ αὐτὸς
πάντα μάλ᾽, οὕνεκα σεῖο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια
εἶδος ἀκιδνοτέρη μέγεθός τ᾽ εἰσάντα ἰδέσθαι:
ἡ μὲν γὰρ βροτός ἐστι, σὺ δ᾽ ἀθάνατος καὶ ἀγήρως.
ἀλλὰ καὶ ὣς ἐθέλω καὶ ἐέλδομαι ἤματα πάντα","“Mighty goddess, be not wroth with me for this. I know full well of myself that wise Penelope is meaner to look upon than thou in comeliness and in stature, for she is a mortal, while thou art immortal and ageless. But even so I wish and long day by day"
5,220,224,"οἴκαδέ τ᾽ ἐλθέμεναι καὶ νόστιμον ἦμαρ ἰδέσθαι.
εἰ δ᾽ αὖ τις ῥαίῃσι θεῶν ἐνὶ οἴνοπι πόντῳ,
τλήσομαι ἐν στήθεσσιν ἔχων ταλαπενθέα θυμόν:
ἤδη γὰρ μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα
κύμασι καὶ πολέμῳ: μετὰ καὶ τόδε τοῖσι γενέσθω.","to reach my home, and to see the day of my return. And if again some god shall smite me on the wine-dark sea, I will endure it, having in my breast a heart that endures affliction. For ere this I have suffered much and toiled much amid the waves and in war; let this also be added unto that.”
"
5,225,227,"ὣς ἔφατ᾽, ἠέλιος δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔδυ καὶ ἐπὶ κνέφας ἦλθεν:
ἐλθόντες δ᾽ ἄρα τώ γε μυχῷ σπείους γλαφυροῖο
τερπέσθην φιλότητι, παρ᾽ ἀλλήλοισι μένοντες.","So he spoke, and the sun set and darkness came on. And the two went into the innermost recess of the hollow cave, and took their joy of love, abiding each by the other's side."
5,228,229,"ἦμος δ᾽ ἠριγένεια φάνη ῥοδοδάκτυλος Ἠώς,
αὐτίχ᾽ ὁ μὲν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε ἕννυτ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς,","
As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, straightway Odysseus put on a cloak and a tunic,"
5,230,234,"αὐτὴ δ᾽ ἀργύφεον φᾶρος μέγα ἕννυτο νύμφη,

καὶ τότ᾽ Ὀδυσσῆι μεγαλήτορι μήδετο πομπήν:
δῶκέν οἱ πέλεκυν μέγαν, ἄρμενον ἐν παλάμῃσι,","and the nymph clothed herself in a long white robe, finely woven and beautiful, and about her waist she cast a fair girdle of gold, and on her head a veil above. Then she set herself to plan the sending of the great-hearted Odysseus. She gave him a great axe, well fitted to his hands,"
5,235,239,"χάλκεον,  ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον: αὐτὰρ ἐν αὐτῷ

κλήθρη τ᾽ αἴγειρός τ᾽, ἐλάτη τ᾽ ἦν οὐρανομήκης,","an axe of bronze, sharpened on both sides; and in it was a beautiful handle of olive wood, securely fastened; and thereafter she gave him a polished adze. Then she led the way to the borders of the island where tall trees were standing, alder and popular and fir, reaching to the skies,"
5,240,244,"αὖα πάλαι,  περίκηλα, τά οἱ πλώοιεν ἐλαφρῶς.

But when she had shewn him where the tall trees grew, Calypso, the beautiful goddess, returned homewards, but he fell to cutting timbers, and his work went forward apace. Twenty trees in all did he fell, and trimmed them with the axe;"
5,245,249,"ξέσσε δ᾽ ἐπισταμένως καὶ ἐπὶ στάθμην ἴθυνεν.

ὅσσον τίς τ᾽ ἔδαφος νηὸς τορνώσεται ἀνὴρ","then he cunningly smoothed them all and made them straight to the line. Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him augers; and he bored all the pieces and fitted them to one another, and with pegs and morticings did he hammer it together. Wide as a man well-skilled in carpentry marks out the curve of the hull of a freight-ship,"
5,250,254,"φορτίδος εὐρείης,  ἐὺ εἰδὼς τεκτοσυνάων,

5,255,259,"πρὸς δ᾽ ἄρα πηδάλιον ποιήσατο,  ὄφρ᾽ ἰθύνοι.

Then he fenced in the whole from stem to stern with willow withes to be a defence against the wave, and strewed much brush thereon. Meanwhile Calypso, the beautiful goddess, brought him cloth to make him a sail, and he fashioned that too with skill."
5,260,261,"ἐν δ᾽ ὑπέρας τε κάλους τε πόδας τ᾽ ἐνέδησεν ἐν αὐτῇ,
μοχλοῖσιν δ᾽ ἄρα τήν γε κατείρυσεν εἰς ἅλα δῖαν.","And he made fast in the raft braces and halyards and sheets, and then with levers forced it down into the bright sea."
5,262,264,"τέτρατον ἦμαρ ἔην, καὶ τῷ τετέλεστο ἅπαντα:
τῷ δ᾽ ἄρα πέμπτῳ πέμπ᾽ ἀπὸ νήσου δῖα Καλυψώ,

Now the fourth day came and all his work was done. And on the fifth the beautiful Calypso sent him on his way from the island after she had bathed him and clothed him in fragrant raiment."
5,265,269,"ἐν δέ οἱ ἀσκὸν ἔθηκε θεὰ μέλανος οἴνοιο

Therein she put abundance of dainties to satisfy his heart, and she sent forth a gentle wind and warm. Gladly then did goodly Odysseus spread his sail to the breeze;"
5,270,274,"αὐτὰρ ὁ πηδαλίῳ ἰθύνετο τεχνηέντως

5,275,279,"οἴη δ᾽ ἄμμορός ἐστι λοετρῶν Ὠκεανοῖο:

But the glorious Earth-shaker, as he came back from the Ethiopians, beheld him from afar, from the mountains of the Solymi: for Odysseus was seen of him sailing over the sea; and he waxed the more wroth in spirit,"
5,285,289,"κινήσας δὲ κάρη προτὶ ὃν μυθήσατο θυμόν:

“Out on it! Surely the gods have changed their purpose regarding Odysseus, while I was among the Ethiopians. And lo, he is near to the land of the Phaeacians, where it is his fate to escape from the great bonds of the woe which has come upon him."
5,290,294,"ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι μέν μίν φημι ἅδην ἐλάαν κακότητος.

So saying, he gathered the clouds, and seizing his trident in his hands troubled the sea, and roused all blasts of all manner of winds, and hid with clouds land and sea alike; and night rushed down from heaven."
5,295,299,"σὺν δ᾽ Εὖρός τε Νότος τ᾽ ἔπεσον Ζέφυρός τε δυσαὴς

Then were the knees of Odysseus loosened and his heart melted, and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
“Ah me, wretched that I am! What is to befall me at the last?"
5,300,304,"δείδω μὴ δὴ πάντα θεὰ νημερτέα εἶπεν,

Even as thus he spoke the great wave smote him from on high, rushing upon him with terrible might, and around it whirled his raft."

At length, however, he came up, and spat forth from his mouth the bitter brine which flowed in streams from his head. Yet even so he did not forget his raft, in evil case though he was,"
5,325,329,"ἀλλὰ μεθορμηθεὶς ἐνὶ κύμασιν ἐλλάβετ᾽ αὐτῆς,

But the daughter of Cadmus, Ino of the fair ankles, saw him, even Leucothea, who of old was a mortal of human speech,"

She was touched with pity for Odysseus, as he wandered and was in sore travail, and she rose up from the deep like a sea-mew on the wing, and sat on the stoutly-bound raft, and spoke, saying:
“Unhappy man, how is it that Poseidon, the earth-shaker,"

So saying, the goddess gave him the veil, and herself plunged again into the surging deep, like a sea-mew; and the dark wave hid her. Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus pondered,"

“Woe is me! Let it not be that some one of the immortals is again weaving a snare for me, that she bids me leave my raft. Nay, but verily I will not yet obey, for afar off mine eyes beheld the land, where she said I was to escape."
5,360,364,"ἀλλὰ μάλ᾽ ὧδ᾽ ἔρξω,  δοκέει δέ μοι εἶναι ἄριστον:

Then for two nights and two days he was driven about over the swollen waves, and full often his heart forboded destruction."
5,390,394,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ τρίτον ἦμαρ ἐυπλόκαμος τέλεσ᾽ Ἠώς,
καὶ τότ᾽ ἔπειτ᾽ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο ἠδὲ γαλήνη

ὡς δ᾽ ὅτ᾽ ἂν ἀσπάσιος βίοτος παίδεσσι φανήῃ","But when fair-tressed Dawn brought to its birth the third day, then the wind ceased and there was a windless calm, and he caught sight of the shore close at hand, casting a quick glance forward, as he was raised up by a great wave. And even as when most welcome to his children appears the life"
5,395,399,"πατρός,  ὃς ἐν νούσῳ κεῖται κρατέρ᾽ ἄλγεα πάσχων,

5,400,404,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε τόσσον ἀπῆν ὅσσον τε γέγωνε βοήσας,

οὐ γὰρ ἔσαν λιμένες νηῶν ὄχοι, οὐδ᾽ ἐπιωγαί.","But when he was as far away as a man's voice carries when he shouts, and heard the boom of the sea upon the reefs—for the great wave thundered against the dry land, belching upon it in terrible fashion, and all things were wrapped in the foam of the sea; for there were neither harbors where ships might ride, nor road-steads,"
5,405,407,"ἀλλ᾽ ἀκταὶ προβλῆτες ἔσαν σπιλάδες τε πάγοι τε:

“Ah me, when Zeus has at length granted me to see the land beyond my hopes, and lo, I have prevailed to cleave my way and to cross this gulf,"
5,410,414,"ἔκβασις οὔ πῃ φαίνεθ᾽ ἁλὸς πολιοῖο θύραζε:

For without are sharp crags, and around them the wave roars foaming, and the rock runs up sheer, and the water is deep close in shore, so that in no wise is it possible to plant both feet firmly and escape ruin."
5,415,419,"μή πώς μ᾽ ἐκβαίνοντα βάλῃ λίθακι ποτὶ πέτρῃ

For I know that the glorious Earth-shaker is filled with wrath against me.”
While he pondered thus in mind and heart,"
5,425,429,"τόφρα δέ μιν μέγα κῦμα φέρε τρηχεῖαν ἐπ᾽ ἀκτήν.

There would his skin have been stripped off and his bones broken, had not the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put a thought in his mind. On he rushed and seized the rock with both hands, and clung to it, groaning, until the great wave went by."
5,430,434,"καὶ τὸ μὲν ὣς ὑπάλυξε,  παλιρρόθιον δέ μιν αὖτις

And just as, when a cuttlefish is dragged from its hole, many pebbles cling to its suckers, even so from his strong hands"
5,435,439,"ῥινοὶ ἀπέδρυφθεν: τὸν δὲ μέγα κῦμα κάλυψεν.

But when, as he swam, he came to the mouth of a fair-flowing river, where seemed to him the best place, since it was smooth of stones, and besides there was shelter from the wind, he knew the river as he flowed forth, and prayed to him in his heart:
"
5,445,449,"κλῦθι,  ἄναξ, ὅτις ἐσσί: πολύλλιστον δέ σ᾽ ἱκάνω,

Reverend even in the eyes of the immortal gods is that man who comes as a wanderer, even as I have now come to thy stream and to thy knees, after many toils."
5,450,450,"ἀλλ᾽ ἐλέαιρε,  ἄναξ: ἱκέτης δέ τοι εὔχομαι εἶναι.","Nay, pity me, O king, for I declare that I am thy suppliant.”"
5,451,454,"ὣς φάθ᾽, ὁ δ᾽ αὐτίκα παῦσεν ἑὸν ῥόον, ἔσχε δὲ κῦμα,

So he spoke, and the god straightway stayed his stream, and checked the waves, and made a calm before him, and brought him safely to the mouth of the river. And he let his two knees bend and his strong hands fall, for his spirit was crushed by the sea."
5,455,459,"ᾤδεε δὲ χρόα πάντα,  θάλασσα δὲ κήκιε πολλὴ

So he lay breathless and speechless, with scarce strength to move; for terrible weariness had come upon him. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast, then he loosed from him the veil of the goddess and let it fall into the river that murmured seaward;"
5,460,464,"καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐς ποταμὸν ἁλιμυρήεντα μεθῆκεν,

But Odysseus, going back from the river, sank down in the reeds and kissed the earth, the giver of grain; and deeply moved he spoke to his own mighty spirit:
"
5,465,469,"ὤ μοι ἐγώ,  τί πάθω; τί νύ μοι μήκιστα γένηται;

If here in the river bed I keep watch throughout the weary night, I fear that together the bitter frost and the fresh dew may overcome me, when from feebleness I have breathed forth my spirit; and the breeze from the river blows cold in the early morning."
5,470,474,"εἰ δέ κεν ἐς κλιτὺν ἀναβὰς καὶ δάσκιον ὕλην

Then, as he pondered, this thing seemed to him the better:"
5,475,479,"βῆ ῥ᾽ ἴμεν εἰς ὕλην: τὴν δὲ σχεδὸν ὕδατος εὗρεν

Through these the strength of the wet winds could never blow, nor the rays of the bright sun beat,"

Likening herself to her, the flashing-eyed Athena spoke and said:

So she spoke, for she was ashamed to name gladsome marriage to her father; but he understood all, and answered, saying: “Neither the mules do I begrudge thee, my child, nor aught beside. Go thy way; the slaves shall make ready for thee the wagon,"

She fled not, but stood and faced him; and Odysseus pondered whether he should clasp the knees of the fair-faced maid, and make his prayer, or whether, standing apart as he was, he should beseech her with gentle words, in hope that she might show him the city and give him raiment."

When the strong and mighty Alcinous heard this, he took by the hand Odysseus, the wise and crafty-minded, and raised him from the hearth, and set him upon a bright chair"

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Prince, rebuke not for this, I pray thee, thy blameless daughter. She did indeed bid me follow with her maidens,"

τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:
Λαοδάμα, τί με ταῦτα κελεύετε κερτομέοντες;
κήδεά μοι καὶ μᾶλλον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἤ περ ἄεθλοι,","Thy journey shall no more be long delayed, nay, even now thy ship is launched and the crew is ready.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Laodamas, why do ye mock me with this challenge? Sorrow is in my mind far more than contests,"
8,155,159,"ὃς πρὶν μὲν μάλα πολλὰ πάθον καὶ πολλὰ μόγησα,
νῦν δὲ μεθ᾽ ὑμετέρῃ ἀγορῇ νόστοιο χατίζων
ἧμαι, λισσόμενος βασιλῆά τε πάντα τε δῆμον.

Then again Euryalus made answer and taunted him to his face: “Nay verily, stranger, for I do not liken thee to a man that is skilled"
8,160,164,"ἄθλων,  οἷά τε πολλὰ μετ᾽ ἀνθρώποισι πέλονται,
ἀλλὰ τῷ, ὅς θ᾽ ἅμα νηὶ πολυκλήιδι θαμίζων,

Thou dost not look like an athlete.”"
8,165,169,"τὸν δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

ἀνδράσιν, οὔτε φυὴν οὔτ᾽ ἂρ φρένας οὔτ᾽ ἀγορητύν.
ἄλλος μὲν γάρ τ᾽ εἶδος ἀκιδνότερος πέλει ἀνήρ,","Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him: “Stranger, thou hast not spoken well; thou art as one blind with folly. So true is it that the gods do not give gracious gifts to all alike, not form nor mind nor eloquence. For one man is inferior in comeliness,"
8,170,174,"ἀλλὰ θεὸς μορφὴν ἔπεσι στέφει,  οἱ δέ τ᾽ ἐς αὐτὸν

Another again is in comeliness like the immortals,"
8,175,179,"ἀλλ᾽ οὔ οἱ χάρις ἀμφιπεριστέφεται ἐπέεσσιν,

ὤρινάς μοι θυμὸν ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισιν

So, in thy case, thy comeliness is preeminent, nor could a god himself mend it, but in mind thou art stunted. Thou hast stirred the spirit in my breast by speaking thus unmannerly. I am not unskilled in sports"
8,180,184,"ὡς σύ γε μυθεῖαι,  ἀλλ᾽ ἐν πρώτοισιν ὀίω

But now I am bound by suffering and pains; for much have I endured in passing through wars of men and the grievous waves. But even so, though I have suffered much, I will make trial of the contests,"
8,185,189,"θυμοδακὴς γὰρ μῦθος,  ἐπώτρυνας δέ με εἰπών.

He spoke, and, leaping up with his cloak about him as it was, seized a discus larger than the rest and thick, no little heavier than those with which the Phaeacians were wont to contend one with another. This with a whirl he sent from his stout hand,"
8,190,194,"βόμβησεν δὲ λίθος: κατὰ δ᾽ ἔπτηξαν ποτὶ γαίῃ

Past the marks of all it flew, speeding lightly from his hand, and Athena, in the likeness of a man, set the mark, and she spoke and addressed him:
"
8,195,198,"καί κ᾽ ἀλαός τοι,  ξεῖνε, διακρίνειε τὸ σῆμα

Be thou of good cheer for this bout at least: no one of the Phaeacians will reach this, or cast beyond it.”"
8,199,199,"ὣς φάτο, γήθησεν δὲ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,","
So she spoke, and the much-enduring goodly Odysseus was glad,"
8,200,204,"χαὶρων,  οὕνεχ᾽ ἑταῖρον ἐνηέα λεῦσσ᾽ ἐν ἀγῶνι.

“Reach this now, young men; and presently, methinks, I will send another after it, as far or even further. Of the rest, if any man's heart and spirit bid him,"
8,205,209,"δεῦρ᾽ ἄγε πειρηθήτω,  ἐπεί μ᾽ ἐχολώσατε λίην,

So he spoke and they were all hushed in silence;"

“Stranger, since not ungraciously dost thou speak thus in our midst, but art minded to shew forth the prowess which waits upon thee, in anger that yonder man came up to thee in the lists and taunted thee in a way in which no mortal would make light of thy prowess,"

So spoke Alcinous the godlike, and the herald rose to fetch the hollow lyre from the palace of the king. Then stood up masters of the lists, nine in all, men chosen from out the people, who in their gatherings were wont to order all things aright."

“Come, love, let us to bed and take our joy, couched together. For Hephaestus is no longer here in the land, but has now gone, I ween, to Lemnos, to visit the Sintians of savage speech.”"
8,295,299,"ὣς φάτο,  τῇ δ᾽ ἀσπαστὸν ἐείσατο κοιμηθῆναι.

“Father Zeus, and ye other blessed gods that are forever, come hither that ye may see a laughable matter and a monstrous, even how Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus, scorns me for that I am lame and loves destructive Ares"

Soon shall both lose their desire to sleep; but the snare and the bonds shall hold them until her father pays back to me all the gifts of wooing that I gave him for the sake of his shameless girl;"
8,320,324,"οὕνεκά οἱ καλὴ θυγάτηρ,  ἀτὰρ οὐκ ἐχέθυμος.

So he spoke and the gods gathered to the house of the brazen floor. Poseidon came, the earth-enfolder, and the helper Hermes came, and the lord Apollo, the archer god. Now the goddesses abode for shame each in her own house,"
8,325,329,"ἔσταν δ᾽ ἐν προθύροισι θεοί,  δωτῆρες ἑάων:

“Ill deeds thrive not. The slow catches the swift;"
8,330,334,"ὡς καὶ νῦν Ἥφαιστος ἐὼν βραδὺς εἷλεν Ἄρηα

Thus they spoke to one another. But to Hermes the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, said:

Then the messenger, Argeiphontes, answered him:“Would that this might befall, lord Apollo, thou archer god—"
8,340,342,"δεσμοὶ μὲν τρὶς τόσσοι ἀπείρονες ἀμφὶς ἔχοιεν,

8,343,344,"ὣς ἔφατ᾽, ἐν δὲ γέλως ὦρτ᾽ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσιν.
οὐδὲ Ποσειδάωνα γέλως ἔχε, λίσσετο δ᾽ αἰεὶ","
So he spoke and laughter arose among the immortal gods. Yet Poseidon laughed not, but ever besought"

“Loose him, and I promise, as thou biddest me, that he shall himself pay thee all that is right in the presence of the immortal gods.”
Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him:"
8,350,354,"μή με,  Ποσείδαον γαιήοχε, ταῦτα κέλευε:

Then again Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him:"

Then the famous god of the two strong arms answered him: “It may not be that I should say thee nay, nor were it seemly.”
So saying the mighty Hephaestus loosed the bonds"

This song the famous minstrel sang. But the heart of Odysseus was melted and tears wet his cheeks beneath his eyelids. And as a woman wails and flings herself about her dear husband, who has fallen in front of his city and his people,"

“Hear me, leaders and counsellors of the Phaeacians, and let Demodocus now check his clear-toned lyre, for in no wise to all alike does he give pleasure with this song. Ever since we began to sup and the divine minstrel was moved to sing,"

And when he had made his meal he drove his fat flocks forth from the cave, easily moving away the great door-stone; and then he put it in place again, as one might set the lid upon a quiver."
9,315,317,"πολλῇ δὲ ῥοίζῳ πρὸς ὄρος τρέπε πίονα μῆλα

“Now this seemed to my mind the best plan. There lay beside a sheep-pen a great club of the Cyclops,"

And I bade my comrades cast lots among them, which of them should have the hardihood with me to lift the stake and grind it into his eye when sweet sleep should come upon him.

“‘Cyclops, take and drink wine after thy meal of human flesh, that thou mayest know what manner of drink this is which our ship contained. It was to thee that I was bringing it as a drink offering, in the hope that, touched with pity,"

“So I spoke, and he took the cup and drained it, and was wondrously pleased as he drank the sweet draught, and asked me for it again a second time:

“He spoke, and reeling fell upon his back, and lay there with his thick neck bent aslant, and sleep, that conquers all, laid hold on him. And from his gullet came forth wine and bits of human flesh, and he vomited in his drunken sleep."

“‘Cyclops, if any one of mortal men shall ask thee about the shameful blinding of thine eye, say that Odysseus, the sacker of cities, blinded it,"

“For six days, then, my trusty comrades feasted on the best of the kine of Helios which they had driven off. But when Zeus, the son of Cronos, brought upon us the seventh day,"
12,400,404,"καὶ τότ᾽ ἔπειτ᾽ ἄνεμος μὲν ἐπαύσατο λαίλαπι θύων,

“But when we had left that island and no other land appeared, but only sky and sea,"
12,405,409,"δὴ τότε κυανέην νεφέλην ἔστησε Κρονίων

ἱστοῦ δὲ προτόνους ἔρρηξ᾽ ἀνέμοιο θύελλα","then verily the son of Cronos set a black cloud above the hollow ship, and the sea grew dark beneath it. She ran on for no long time, for straightway came the shrieking West Wind, blowing with a furious tempest, and the blast of the wind snapped both the fore-stays of the mast,"

On the stern of the ship the mast struck the head of the pilot and crushed all the bones of his skull together, and like a diver he fell from the deck and his proud spirit left his bones."
12,415,419,"Ζεὺς δ᾽ ἄμυδις βρόντησε καὶ ἔμβαλε νηὶ κεραυνόν:

Like sea-crows they were borne on the waves about the black ship, and the god took from them their returning."
12,420,424,"αὐτὰρ ἐγὼ διὰ νηὸς ἐφοίτων,  ὄφρ᾽ ἀπὸ τοίχους

12,425,425,ἑζόμενος δ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῖς φερόμην ὀλοοῖς ἀνέμοισιν.,and sitting on these was borne by the direful winds.

“Then verily the West Wind ceased to blow tempestuously, and swiftly the South Wind came, bringing sorrow to my heart, that I might traverse again the way to baneful Charybdis. All night long was I borne, and at the rising of the sun"

She verily sucked down the salt water of the sea, but I, springing up to the tall fig-tree, laid hold of it, and clung to it like a bat. Yet I could in no wise plant my feet firmly or climb upon the tree,"

There I clung steadfastly until she should vomit forth mast and keel again, and to my joy they came at length. At the hour when a man rises from the assembly for his supper,"
12,440,444,"κρίνων νείκεα πολλὰ δικαζομένων αἰζηῶν,

And I let go hands and feet from above and plunged down into the waters out beyond the long spars, and sitting on these I rowed onward with my hands."

“Thence for nine days was I borne, and on the tenth night the gods brought me to Ogygia, where the fair-tressed Calypso dwells, dread goddess of human speech,"

So spake Alcinous, and his word was pleasing to them. They then went, each man to his house, to take their rest; but as soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered, they hastened to the ship and brought the bronze, that gives strength to men."

For I but now declared that Odysseus should suffer many woes ere he reached his home, though I did not wholly rob him of his return when once thou hadst promised it and confirmed it with thy nod; yet in his sleep these men have borne him in a swift ship over the sea"
13,135,138,"κάτθεσαν εἰν Ἰθάκῃ,  ἔδοσαν δέ οἱ ἄσπετα  δῶρα,
χαλκόν τε χρυσόν τε ἅλις ἐσθῆτά θ᾽ ὑφαντήν,
πόλλ᾽, ὅσ᾽ ἂν οὐδέ ποτε Τροίης ἐξήρατ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς,
εἴ περ ἀπήμων ἦλθε, λαχὼν ἀπὸ ληΐδος αἶσαν.","and set him down in Ithaca, and have given him gifts past telling, stores of bronze and gold and woven raiment, more than Odysseus would ever have won for himself from Troy, if he had returned unscathed with his due share of the spoil.”"
13,139,139,τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεὺς:,"
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him, and said:"
13,140,144,"ὢ πόποι,  ἐννοσίγαι᾽ εὐρυσθενές, οἷον ἔειπες.
οὔ τί σ᾽ ἀτιμάζουσι θεοί: χαλεπὸν δέ κεν εἴη
πρεσβύτατον καὶ ἄριστον ἀτιμίῃσιν ἰάλλειν.
ἀνδρῶν δ᾽ εἴ πέρ τίς σε βίῃ καὶ κάρτεϊ εἴκων
οὔ τι τίει. σοὶ δ᾽ ἐστὶ καὶ ἐξοπίσω τίσις αἰεί.","“Ah me, thou shaker of the earth, wide of sway, what a thing hast thou said! The gods do thee no dishonor; hard indeed would it be to assail with dishonor our eldest and best. But as for men, if any one, yielding to his might and strength, fails to do thee honor in aught, thou mayest ever take vengeance, even thereafter."
13,145,149,"ἔρξον ὅπως ἐθέλεις καί τοι φίλον ἔπλετο θυμῷ.
τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων:
αἶψά κ᾽ ἐγὼν ἔρξαιμι, κελαινεφές, ὡς ἀγορεύεις:
ἀλλὰ σὸν αἰεὶ θυμὸν ὀπίζομαι ἠδ᾽ ἀλεείνω.
νῦν αὖ Φαιήκων ἐθέλω περικαλλέα νῆα,","Do as thou wilt, and as is thy good pleasure.”
Then Poseidon, the earth-shaker, answered him: “Straightway should I have done as thou sayest, thou god of the dark clouds, but I ever dread and avoid thy wrath. But now I am minded to smite the fair ship of the Phaeacians,"
13,150,154,"ἐκ πομπῆς ἀνιοῦσαν,  ἐν ἠεροειδέϊ πόντῳ

τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:
ὢ πέπον, ὡς μὲν ἐμῷ θυμῷ δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα,","as she comes back from his convoy on the misty deep, that hereafter they may desist and cease from giving convoy to men, and to fling a great mountain about their city.”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered him and said: “Lazy one, hear what seems best in my sight."
13,155,159,"ὁππότε κεν δὴ πάντες ἐλαυνομένην προΐδωνται

αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γ᾽ ἄκουσε Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων,","When all the people are looking forth from the city upon her as she speeds on her way, then do thou turn her to stone hard by the land—a stone in the shape of a swift ship, that all men may marvel; and do thou fling a great mountain about their city.”
Now when Poseidon, the earth-shaker, heard this"
13,160,164,"βῆ ῥ᾽ ἴμεν ἐς Σχερίην,  ὅθι Φαίηκες γεγάασιν.

And she drew close to shore, the seafaring ship, speeding swiftly on her way. Then near her came the Earth-shaker and turned her to stone, and rooted her fast beneath by a blow of the flat of his hand, and then he was gone.
"
13,165,169,"οἱ δὲ πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἔπεα πτερόεντ᾽ ἀγόρευον

“Ah me, who has now bound our swift ship on the sea as she sped homeward? Lo, she was in plain sight.”
"
13,170,174,"ὣς ἄρα τις εἴπεσκε: τὰ δ᾽ οὐκ ἴσαν ὡς ἐτέτυκτο.

“Lo now, verily the oracles of my father, uttered long ago, have come upon me. He was wont to say that Poseidon was wroth with us because we give safe convoy to all men."
13,175,179,"φῆ ποτὲ Φαιήκων ἀνδρῶν περικαλλέα, νῆα,

So that old man spoke, and lo, now all this is being brought to pass. But now come, as I bid let us all obey."
13,180,183,"πομπῆς μὲν παύσασθε βροτῶν,  ὅτε κέν τις ἵκηται

13,184,184,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἔδεισαν, ἑτοιμάσσαντο δὲ ταύρους.","
So he spoke, and they were seized with fear and made ready the bulls."
13,185,189,"ὣς οἱ μέν ῥ᾽ εὔχοντο Ποσειδάωνι ἄνακτι

Yet he knew it not after his long absence, for about him the goddess had shed a mist,"

So he sprang up and stood and looked upon his native land, and then he groaned and smote both of his thighs with the flat of his hands, and mournfully spoke, and said:

Are they cruel, and wild, and unjust, or do they love strangers and fear the gods in their thoughts? Whither shall I bear all this wealth, or whither shall I myself go wandering on? Would that I had remained there among the Phaeacians,"

Verily they said that they would bring me to clear-seen Ithaca, but they have not made good their word. May Zeus, the suppliant's god, requite them, who watches over all men, and punishes him that sins."
13,215,216,"ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε δὴ τὰ χρήματ᾽ ἀριθμήσω καὶ ἴδωμαι,

So he spake, and set him to count the beautiful tripods, and the cauldrons, and the gold, and the fair woven raiment, and of these he missed nothing. Then, mournfully longing for his native land,"

But after we had sacked the lofty city of Priam, and had gone away in our ships, and a god had scattered the Achaeans, never since then have I seen thee, daughter of Zeus, nor marked thee coming on board my ship, that thou mightest ward off sorrow from me."
13,320,324,"ἀλλ᾽ αἰεὶ φρεσὶν ᾗσιν ἔχων δεδαϊγμένον ἦτορ

But now I beseech thee by thy father—for I think not"

13,329,329,τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:,"
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:"
13,330,334,"αἰεί τοι τοιοῦτον ἐνὶ στήθεσσι νόημα:

Eagerly would another man on his return from wanderings have hastened to behold in his halls his children and his wife;"
13,335,339,"σοὶ δ᾽ οὔ πω φίλον ἐστὶ δαήμεναι οὐδὲ πυθέσθαι,

Yet, thou must know, I was not minded to strive against Poseidon, my father's brother, who laid up wrath in his heart against thee, angered that thou didst blind his dear son.

13,345,349,"Φόρκυνος μὲν ὅδ᾽ ἐστὶ λιμήν,  ἁλίοιο γέροντος,

So spake the goddess, and scattered the mist, and the land appeared. Glad then was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, rejoicing in his own land, and he kissed the earth, the giver of grain."
13,355,359,"αὐτίκα δὲ νύμφῃς ἠρήσατο, χεῖρας ἀνασχών:

“Ye Naiad Nymphs, daughters of Zeus, never did I think to behold you again, but now I hail you with loving prayers. Aye, and gifts too will I give, as aforetime, if the daughter of Zeus, she that drives the spoil, shall graciously grant me"
13,360,364,"αὐτόν τε ζώειν καί μοι φίλον υἱὸν ἀέξῃ.

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him again: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us now forthwith set thy goods in the innermost recess of the wondrous cave, where they may abide for thee in safety,"
13,365,365,αὐτοὶ δὲ φραζώμεθ᾽ ὅπως ὄχ᾽ ἄριστα γένηται.,and let us ourselves take thought how all may be far the best.”

So saying, the goddess entered the shadowy cave and searched out its hiding-places. And Odysseus brought all the treasure thither, the gold and the stubborn bronze and the finely-wrought raiment, which the Phaeacians gave him."

Then the two sat them down by the trunk of the sacred olive tree, and devised death for the insolent wooers. And the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, was the first to speak, saying:

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lo now, of a surety I was like to have perished in my halls by the evil fate of Agamemnon, son of Atreus,"

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Why then, I pray thee, didst thou not tell him, thou whose mind knows all things? Nay, was it haply that he too might suffer woes, wandering over the unresting sea, and that others might devour his substance?”

For verily the gods have stayed the return of him who would have loved me with all kindness, and would have given me possessions of my own, a house and a bit of land, and a wife, sought of many wooers, even such things as a kindly master gives to his thrall"
14,65,69,"ὅς οἱ πολλὰ κάμῃσι,  θεὸς δ᾽ ἐπὶ ἔργον ἀέξῃ,
ὡς καὶ ἐμοὶ τόδε ἔργον ἀέξεται, ᾧ ἐπιμίμνω.
τῷ κέ με πόλλ᾽ ὤνησεν ἄναξ, εἰ αὐτόθ᾽ ἐγήρα:
ἀλλ᾽ ὄλεθ᾽—ὡς ὤφελλ᾽ Ἑλένης ἀπὸ φῦλον ὀλέσθαι
πρόχνυ, ἐπεὶ πολλῶν ἀνδρῶν ὑπὸ γούνατ᾽ ἔλυσε:","who has toiled much for him, and whose labour the god makes to prosper, even as this work of mine prospers, to which I give heed. Therefore would my master have richly rewarded me, if he had grown old here at home: but he perished—as I would all the kindred of Helen had perished in utter ruin, since she loosened the knees of many warriors."
14,70,71,"καὶ γὰρ κεῖνος ἔβη Ἀγαμέμνονος εἵνεκα τιμῆς
Ἴλιον εἰς εὔπωλον, ἵνα Τρώεσσι μάχοιτο.","For he too went forth to win recompense for Agamemnon to Ilios, famed for its horses, that he might fight with the Trojans.”"
14,72,74,"ὣς εἰπὼν ζωστῆρι θοῶς συνέεργε χιτῶνα,

ἔνθεν ἑλὼν δύ᾽ ἔνεικε καὶ ἀμφοτέρους ἱέρευσεν,","
So saying, he quickly bound up his tunic with his belt, and went to the sties, where the tribes of swine were penned. Choosing two from thence, he brought them in and slew them both,"
14,75,79,"εὗσέ τε μίστυλλέν τε καὶ ἀμφ᾽ ὀβελοῖσιν ἔπειρεν.
ὀπτήσας δ᾽ ἄρα πάντα φέρων παρέθηκ᾽ Ὀδυσῆϊ

Then, when he had roasted all, he brought and set it before Odysseus, hot upon the spits, and sprinkled over it white barley meal. Then in a bowl of ivy wood he mixed honey-sweet wine, and himself sat down over against Odysseus, and bade him to his food, and said:
"
14,80,84,"ἔσθιε νῦν, ὦ ξεῖνε, τά τε δμώεσσι πάρεστι,

ἀλλὰ δίκην τίουσι καὶ αἴσιμα ἔργ᾽ ἀνθρώπων.","“Eat now, stranger, such food as slaves have to offer, meat of young pigs; the fatted hogs the wooers eat, who reck not in their hearts of the wrath of the gods, nor have any pity. Verily the blessed gods love not reckless deeds, but they honor justice and the righteous deeds of men."
14,85,89,"καὶ μὲν δυσμενέες καὶ ἀνάρσιοι,  οἵ τ᾽ ἐπὶ γαίης

But these men here, look you, know somewhat, and have heard some voice of a god"
14,90,94,"κείνου λυγρὸν ὄλεθρον,  ὅτ᾽ οὐκ ἐθέλουσι δικαίως

For every day and night that comes from Zeus they sacrifice not one victim nor two alone,"
14,95,99,"οἶνον δὲ φθινύθουσιν ὑπέρβιον ἐξαφύοντες.

Verily his substance was great past telling, so much has no lord either on the dark mainland or in Ithaca itself; nay, not twenty men together have wealth so great. Lo, I will tell thee the tale thereof;"
14,100,104,"δώδεκ᾽ ἐν ἠπείρῳ ἀγέλαι: τόσα πώεα οἰῶν,

And here too graze roving herds of goats on the borders of the island, eleven in all, and over them trusty men keep watch."
14,105,108,"τῶν αἰεί σφιν ἕκαστος ἐπ᾽ ἤματι μῆλον ἀγινεῖ,

14,109,109,"ὣς φάθ᾽, ὁ δ᾽ ἐνδυκέως κρέα τ᾽ ἤσθιε πῖνέ τε οἶνον","
So he spoke, but Odysseus eagerly ate flesh and drank wine,"
14,110,114,"ἁρπαλέως ἀκέων,  κακὰ δὲ μνηστῆρσι φύτευεν.

But when he had dined, and satisfied his soul with food, then the swineherd filled the bowl from which he was himself wont to drink, and gave it him brim full of wine, and he took it, and was glad at heart; and he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:

Thou saidest that he died to win recompense for Agamemnon; tell me, if haply I may know him, being such an one. For Zeus, I ween, and the other immortal gods know"

Then the swineherd, a leader of men, answered him: “Old man, no wanderer that came and brought tidings of him could persuade his wife and his dear son; nay, at random, when they have need of entertainment, do vagabonds"

To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Eat, unhappy stranger, and have joy of such fare as is here. It is the god that will give one thing and withhold another,"

To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Old man, the tale thou hast told is a good one, nor hast thou thus far spoken aught amiss or unprofitably."

Nor will any one send us away empty-handed, but will give us some one thing at least to bear with us, a fair brazen tripod or cauldron,"
15,85,89,"ἠὲ δύ᾽ ἡμιόνους ἠὲ χρύσειον ἄλεισον.
τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:

οὖρον ἰὼν κατέλειπον ἐπὶ κτεάτεσσιν ἐμοῖσιν:","or a pair of mules, or a golden cup.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Menelaus, son of Atreus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, rather would I go at once to my home, for when I departed I left behind me no one to watch over my possessions."
15,90,91,"μὴ πατέρ᾽ ἀντίθεον διζήμενος αὐτὸς ὄλωμαι,
ἤ τί μοι ἐκ μεγάρων κειμήλιον ἐσθλὸν ὄληται.","I would not that in seeking for my god-like father I myself should perish, or some goodly treasure be lost from my halls.”"
15,92,94,"αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ τό γ᾽ ἄκουσε βοὴν ἀγαθὸς Μενέλαος,
αὐτίκ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ᾗ ἀλόχῳ ἠδὲ δμῳῇσι κέλευσε

Now when Menelaus, good in battle, heard this, he straightway bade his wife and her handmaids make ready a meal in the halls of the abundant store that was within."
15,95,99,"ἀγχίμολον δέ οἱ ἦλθε Βοηθοΐδης Ἐτεωνεύς,

Him Menelaus, good at the war-cry, bade kindle a fire and roast of the flesh; and he heard, and obeyed. And Menelaus himself went down to his vaulted treasure-chamber,"
15,100,104,"οὐκ οἶος,  ἅμα τῷ γ᾽ Ἑλένη κίε καὶ Μεγαπένθης.

“Telemachus, may Zeus, the loud-thundering lord of Here, verily bring to pass for thee thy return, even as thy heart desires. And of all the gifts that lie stored as treasures in my house, I will give thee that one which is fairest and costliest."

It is all of silver, and with gold are the rims thereof gilded, the work of Hephaestus; and the warrior Phaedimus, king of the Sidonians, gave it me, when his house sheltered me as I came thither; and now I am minded to give it to thee.”

And the strong Megapenthes brought the bright mixing-bowl of silver and set it before him, and fair-cheeked Helen came up with the robe in her hands, and spoke, and addressed him:

15,130,134,"ὣς εἰποῦσ᾽ ἐν χερσὶ τίθει,  ὁ δ᾽ ἐδέξατο χαίρων.

And the prince Peisistratus took the gifts, and laid them in the box of the chariot, and gazed at them all wondering in his heart. Then fair-haired Menelaus led them to the house, and the two sat down on chairs and high seats."
15,135,139,"χέρνιβα δ᾽ ἀμφίπολος προχόῳ ἐπέχευε φέρουσα

And the grave housewife brought and set before them bread, and therewith meats in abundance, granting freely of her store."

“Fare ye well, young men, and bear greeting to Nestor, shepherd of the host, for verily he was kind as a father to me, while we sons of the Achaeans warred in the land of Troy.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him:"

“Consider, Menelaus, fostered of Zeus, leader of hosts, whether it was for us two that the god showed this sign, or for thyself.”
so he spoke, and Menelaus, dear to Ares, pondered"
15,170,174,"ὅππως οἱ κατὰ μοῖραν ὑποκρίναιτο νοήσας.

“Hear me, and I will prophesy as the immortals put it into my heart, and as I think it will be brought to pass. Even as this eagle came"
15,175,178,"ἐλθὼν ἐξ ὄρεος,  ὅθι οἱ γενεή τε τόκος τε,

15,179,179,τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:,"
Then again wise Telemachus answered her:"
15,180,184,"οὕτω νῦν Ζεὺς θείη, ἐρίγδουπος πόσις Ἥρης:

He spoke, and touched the two horses with the lash, and they sped swiftly toward the plain, coursing eagerly through the city. So all day long they shook the yoke they bore about their necks."
15,185,189,"δύσετό τ᾽ ἠέλιος σκιόωντό τε πᾶσαι ἀγυιαί:

As soon as early Dawn appeared, the rosy-fingered,"
15,190,194,"ἵππους τε ζεύγνυντ᾽ ἀνά θ᾽ ἅρματα ποικίλ᾽ ἔβαινον,

Then Peisistratus touched the horses with the whip to start them, and nothing loath the pair sped onward, and soon thereafter they reached the steep citadel of Pylos. Then Telemachus spoke to the son of Nestor, saying:
"
15,195,199,"Νεστορίδη,  πῶς κέν μοι ὑποσχόμενος τελέσειας

Friends from of old we call ourselves by reason of our fathers' friendship, and we are moreover of the same age, and this journey shall yet more stablish us in oneness of heart. Lead me not past my ship, O thou fostered of Zeus, but leave me there,"
15,200,204,"μή μ᾽ ὁ γέρων ἀέκοντα κατάσχῃ ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ

ὧδε δέ οἱ φρονέοντι δοάσσατο κέρδιον εἶναι:","lest that old man keep me in his house against my will, fain to show me kindness, whereas I must needs hasten home.”
So he spoke, and the son of Nestor took counsel with his heart, how he might duly give the promise and fulfil it. And, as he pondered, this seemed to him the better course."
15,205,209,"στρέψ᾽ ἵππους ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν καὶ θῖνα θαλάσσης,

“Make haste now to go on board, and bid all thy comrades to do likewise,"
15,210,214,"πρὶν ἐμὲ οἴκαδ᾽ ἱκέσθαι ἀπαγγεῖλαί τε γέροντι.

“Set all the gear in order, men, in the black ship, and let us go on board ourselves, that we may speed on our way.”

Of Ithaca I am by birth, and my father is Odysseus, as sure as ever such a one there was; but now he has perished by a pitiful fate. Therefore have I now taken my comrades and a black ship,"

Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Even so have I, too, fled from my country, for that I slew a man, one of mine own kin. And many brethren and kinsmen of his there are in horse-pasturing Argos, and mightily do they bear sway over the Achaeans."

“Telemachus, surely not without a god's warrant has this bird flown forth upon our right, for I knew, as I looked upon him, that he was a bird of omen. Than yours is no other house in the land of Ithaca more kingly; nay, ye are ever supreme.”

Therewith he spoke to Peiraeus, his trusty comrade:"

So saying, he went on board the ship, and bade his comrades themselves to embark and to loose the stern cables. So they went on board straightway, and sat down upon the benches."

“Eumaeus, surely some comrade of thine will be coming, or at least some one thou knowest, for the hounds do not bark,"

Not yet was the word fully uttered, when his own dear son stood in the doorway. In amazement up sprang the swineherd, and from his hands the vessels fell with which he was busied as he mixed the flaming wine. And he went to meet his lord,"

“Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes. I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to Pylos."

But verily, as regards this stranger, now that he has come to thy house, I will clothe him in a cloak and tunic, fair raiment,"
16,80,84,"δώσω δὲ ξίφος ἄμφηκες καὶ ποσσὶ πέδιλα,

Or, if thou wilt, do thou keep him here at the farmstead, and care for him, and raiment will I send hither and all his food to eat, that he be not the ruin of thee and of thy men."
16,85,89,"κεῖσε δ᾽ ἂν οὔ μιν ἐγώ γε μετὰ μνηστῆρας ἐῷμι

And to achieve aught is hard for one man among many, how mighty soever he be, for verily they are far stronger.”"
16,90,94,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:

Or hast thou cause to blame thy brothers, in whose fighting a man trusts even if a great strife arise. Would that with my present temper I were as young as thou,"
16,100,104,"ἢ παῖς ἐξ Ὀδυσῆος ἀμύμονος ἠὲ καὶ αὐτός:

And she neither refuses the hateful marriage, nor is she able to make an end; but they with feasting consume my substance, and will ere long bring me, too, to ruin. Yet these things verily lie on the knees of the gods."

Then wise Telemachus answered him: “'Tis the sadder; but none the less we will let him be, despite our sorrow; for if in any wise all things might be had by mortals for the wishing, we should choose first of all the day of my father's return."

With this he roused the swineherd, and he took his sandals in his hands"

Nor was Athena unaware that the swineherd Eumaeus was gone from the farmstead, but she drew near in the likeness of a woman, comely and tall, and skilled in glorious handiwork.

16,160,164,"οὐδ᾽ ἄρα Τηλέμαχος ἴδεν ἀντίον οὐδ᾽ ἐνόησεν,

But Odysseus saw her, and the hounds, and they barked not, but with whining slunk in fear to the further side of the farmstead. The she made a sign with her brows, and goodly Odysseus perceived it,"
16,165,169,"ἐκ δ᾽ ἦλθεν μεγάροιο παρὲκ μέγα τειχίον αὐλῆς,

“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, even now do thou reveal thy word to thy son, and hide it not, that when you two have planned death and fate for the wooers,"
16,170,174,"ἔρχησθον προτὶ ἄστυ περικλυτόν: οὐδ᾽ ἐγὼ αὐτὴ

With this, Athena touched him with her golden wand. A well-washed cloak and a tunic she first of all cast about his breast, and she increased his stature and his youthful bloom."
16,175,179,"ἂψ δὲ μελαγχροιὴς γένετο,  γναθμοὶ δὲ τάνυσθεν,

Then, when she had wrought thus, she departed, but Odysseus went into the hut. And his dear son marvelled, and, seized with fear, turned his eyes aside, lest it should be a god."
16,180,184,"καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:

ἀλλ᾽ ἵληθ᾽, ἵνα τοι κεχαρισμένα δώομεν ἱρὰ","And he spoke, and addressed him with winged words:
“Of other sort thou seemest to me now, stranger, than awhile ago, and other are the garments thou hast on, and thy color is no more the same. Verily thou art a god, one of those who hold broad heaven. Nay then, be gracious, that we may offer to thee acceptable sacrifices"
16,185,185,"ἠδὲ χρύσεα δῶρα,  τετυγμένα: φείδεο δ᾽ ἡμέων","and golden gifts, finely wrought; but do thou spare us.”"
16,186,189,"τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:

Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered him: “Be sure I am no god; why dost thou liken me to the immortals? Nay, I am thy father, for whose sake thou dost with groaning endure many griefs, and submittest to the violence of men.” 
"
16,190,194,"ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας υἱὸν κύσε,  κὰδ δὲ παρειῶν

“Thou verily art not my father Odysseus, but some god"
16,195,199,"θέλγει,  ὄφρ᾽ ἔτι μᾶλλον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω.

16,200,204,"νῦν δὲ θεοῖσιν ἔοικας,  οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι.

οὐ μὲν γάρ τοι ἔτ᾽ ἄλλος ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς,","whereas now thou art like the gods, who hold broad heaven.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Telemachus, it beseems thee not to wonder overmuch that thy father is in the house, or to be amazed. For thou mayest be sure no other Odysseus will ever come hither;"
16,205,209,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅδ᾽ ἐγὼ τοιόσδε,  παθὼν κακά, πολλὰ δ᾽ ἀληθείς,

But this, thou must know, is the work of Athena, driver of the spoil, who makes me such as she will—for she has the power—now like a beggar, and now again"
16,210,214,"ἀνδρὶ νέῳ καὶ καλὰ περὶ χροῒ εἵματ᾽ ἔχοντι.

So saying, he sat down, and Telemachus, flinging his arms about his noble father, wept and shed tears,"
16,215,219,"ἀμφοτέροισι δὲ τοῖσιν ὑφ᾽ ἵμερος ὦρτο γόοιο:

And they wailed aloud more vehemently than birds, sea-eagles, or vultures with crooked talons, whose young the country-folk have taken from their nest before they were fledged; even so piteously did they let tears fall from beneath their brows."
16,220,224,"καί νύ κ᾽ ὀδυρομένοισιν ἔδυ φάος ἠελίοιο,

“In what manner of ship, dear father, have sailors now brought thee hither to Ithaca? Who did they declare themselves to be? For nowise, methinks, didst thou come hither on foot.”"
16,225,229,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:

The Phaeacians brought me, men famed for their ships, who send other men too on their way, whosoever comes to them. And they brought me as I slept in a swift ship over the sea,"
16,230,234,"κάτθεσαν εἰς Ἰθάκην,  ἔπορον δέ μοι ἀγλαὰ δῶρα,

It could not be that two men should fight against many men and mighty."

16,265,265,ἀνδράσι τε κρατέουσι καὶ ἀθανάτοισι θεοῖσι.,rule over all men alike and the immortal gods.”
16,266,269,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:
οὐ μέν τοι κείνω γε πολὺν χρόνον ἀμφὶς ἔσεσθον
φυλόπιδος κρατερῆς, ὁπότε μνηστῆρσι καὶ ἡμῖν
ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσι μένος κρίνηται Ἄρηος.","
Then the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus answered: “Not long of a surety will those two hold aloof from the mighty fray, when between the wooers and us in my halls the might of Ares is put to the test."
16,270,274,"ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν νῦν ἔρχευ ἅμ᾽ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν

εἰ δέ μ᾽ ἀτιμήσουσι δόμον κάτα, σὸν δὲ φίλον κῆρ","But for the present, do thou go at daybreak to thy house and join the company of the haughty wooers. As for me, the swineherd will lead me later on to the city in the likeness of a woeful and aged beggar. And if they shall put despite on me in the house,"
16,275,279,"τετλάτω ἐν στήθεσσι κακῶς πάσχοντος ἐμεῖο,

Thou shalt indeed bid them cease their folly, seeking to dissuade them with gentle words; yet in no wise"
16,280,284,"πείσονται: δὴ γάρ σφι παρίσταται αἴσιμον ἦμαρ.

When Athena, rich in counsel, shall put it in my mind, I will nod to thee with my head; and do thou thereupon, when thou notest it, take all the weapons of war that lie in thy halls,"
16,285,289,"ἐς μυχὸν ὑψηλοῦ θαλάμου καταθεῖναι ἀείρας

“‘Out of the smoke have I laid them, since they are no longer like those which of old Odysseus left behind him when he went forth to Troy,"
16,290,294,"ἀλλὰ κατῄκισται,  ὅσσον πυρὸς ἵκετ᾽ ἀϋτμή.

And furthermore this greater fear has the son of Cronos put in my heart, lest haply, when heated with wine, you may set a quarrel afoot among you and wound one another, and so bring shame on your feast and on your wooing. For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’

16,300,304,"εἰ ἐτεόν γ᾽ ἐμός ἐσσι καὶ αἵματος ἡμετέροιο,

16,308,309,"τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσεφώνεε φαίδιμος υἱός

Then his glorious son answered him, and said: “Father, my spirit, methinks,"

Yet verily, as for the women, I do bid thee learn who among them dishonor thee, and who are guiltless. But of the men in the farmsteads I would not that we should make trial, but that we should deal therewith hereafter,"
16,320,324,"εἰ ἐτεόν γέ τι οἶσθα Διὸς τέρας αἰγιόχοιο.

Thus they spoke to one another, but meanwhile into Ithaca put the well-built ship that brought Telemachus and all his comrades from Pylos; and they, when they had come into the deep harbor,"
16,325,329,"νῆα μὲν οἵ γε μέλαιναν ἐπ᾽ ἠπείροιο ἔρυσσαν,

16,335,339,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δή ῥ᾽ ἵκοντο δόμον θείου βασιλῆος,

But the swineherd came close to Penelope and told her all that her dear son had bidden him say."
16,340,344,"αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ δὴ πᾶσαν ἐφημοσύνην ἀπέειπε,

But the wooers were dismayed and downcast in spirit, and forth they went from the hall past the great wall of the court, and there before the gates they sat down."
16,345,349,"τοῖσιν δ᾽ Εὐρύμαχος,  Πολύβου πάϊς, ἦρχ᾽ ἀγορεύειν:

“My friends, verily a great deed has been insolently brought to pass by Telemachus, even this journey, and we deemed that he would never see it accomplished. But come, let us launch a black ship, the best we have, and let us get together seamen as rowers that they may straightway"
16,350,350,κείνοις ἀγγείλωσι θοῶς οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι.,bear tidings to those others speedily to return home.”
16,351,354,"οὔ πω πᾶν εἴρηθ᾽, ὅτ᾽ ἄρ᾽ Ἀμφίνομος ἴδε νῆα,

Not yet was the word fully uttered when Amphinomus, turning in his place, saw a ship in the deep harbor and men furling the sail, and with oars in their hands. Then, breaking into a merry laugh, he spoke among his comrades:
"

So he spoke, and they rose up and went to the shore of the sea. Swiftly the men drew up the black ship on the shore,"
16,360,364,"τεύχεα δέ σφ᾽ ἀπένεικαν ὑπέρθυμοι θεράποντες.

“Lo, now, see how the gods have delivered this man from destruction."

But, on our part, let us here devise for him a woeful death, even for Telemachus, and let him not escape from out our hands, for I deem that while he lives this work of ours will not prosper. For he is himself shrewd in counsel and in wisdom,"
16,375,379,"λαοὶ δ᾽ οὐκέτι πάμπαν ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν ἦρα φέρουσιν.

Nay, come, before he gathers the Achaeans to the place of assembly—for methinks he will in no wise be slow to act, but will be full of wrath, and rising up will declare among them all how that we contrived against him utter destruction, but did not catch him;"
16,380,384,"οἱ δ᾽ οὐκ αἰνήσουσιν ἀκούοντες κακὰ ἔργα:

Beware, then, lest they work us some harm and drive us out from our country, and we come to the land of strangers.

16,393,394,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ἀκὴν ἐγένοντο σιωπῇ.
τοῖσιν δ᾽ Ἀμφίνομος ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπε,","
So he spoke, and they were all hushed in silence. Then Amphinomus addressed their assembly, and spoke among them."

He it was who with good intent addressed their assembly, and spoke among them:
"
16,400,404,"ὦ φίλοι,  οὐκ ἂν ἐγώ γε κατακτείνειν ἐθέλοιμι

16,405,409,"εἰ δέ κ᾽ ἀποτρωπῶσι θεοί,  παύσασθαι ἄνωγα.

Thus spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. So they arose straightway and went to the house of Odysseus, and entering in, sat down on the polished seats.
Then the wise Penelope took other counsel,"
16,410,414,"μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι ὑπέρβιον ὕβριν ἔχουσι.

But at evening the goodly swineherd came back to Odysseus and his son, and they were busily making ready their supper, and had slain a boar of a year old. Then Athena"

"
16,460,464,"τὸν καὶ Τηλέμαχος πρότερος πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν:

Have the proud wooers by this time come home from their ambush, or are they still watching for me where they were, to take me on my homeward way?”
To him, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:"
16,465,469,"οὐκ ἔμελέν μοι ταῦτα μεταλλῆσαι καὶ ἐρέσθαι
ἄστυ καταβλώσκοντα: τάχιστά με θυμὸς ἀνώγει

But there joined me a swift messenger from thy companions, a herald, who was the first to tell the news to thy mother."
16,470,474,"ἄλλο δέ τοι τό γε οἶδα: τὸ γὰρ ἴδον ὀφθαλμοῖσιν.

I was now above the city, as I went on my way, where the hill of Hermes is, when I saw a swift ship putting into our harbor, and there were many men in her, and she was laden with shields and double-pointed spears."
16,475,479,"καὶ σφέας ὠΐσθην τοὺς ἔμμεναι, οὐδέ τι οἶδα.

δαίνυντ᾽, οὐδέ τι θυμὸς ἐδεύετο δαιτὸς ἐΐσης.","And I thought it was they, but I have no knowledge.”
So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus smiled and with his eyes he glanced at his father, but shunned the swineherd's eye.
And when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they fell to feasting, nor did their hearts lack aught of the equal feast."
16,480,481,"αὐτὰρ ἐπεὶ πόσιος καὶ ἐδητύος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,
κοίτου τε μνήσαντο καὶ ὕπνου δῶρον ἕλοντο.","But when they had put from them the desire of food and drink, they bethought them of rest, and took the gift of sleep."

“Father, I verily am going to the city, that my mother may see me, for, methinks, she will not cease from woeful wailing and tearful lamentation until she sees my very self. But to thee I give this charge."
17,10,14,"τὸν ξεῖνον δύστηνον ἄγ᾽ ἐς πόλιν,  ὄφρ᾽ ἂν ἐκεῖθι

For my part, I can in no wise burden myself with all men, seeing that I have grief at heart. But if the stranger is sore angered at this,"
17,15,19,"ἔσσεται: ἦ γὰρ ἐμοὶ φίλ᾽ ἀληθέα μυθήσασθαι.

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Friend, be sure I am not myself fain to be left here. For a beggar it is better to beg his food in the town than in the fields, and whoso will shall give it me."
17,20,24,"οὐ γὰρ ἐπὶ σταθμοῖσι μένειν ἔτι τηλίκος εἰμί,

Nay, go thy way; this man that thou biddest will lead me as soon as I have warmed myself at the fire, and the sun has grown hot. For miserably poor are these garments which I wear, and I fear lest"
17,25,29,"στίβη ὑπηοίη: ἕκαθεν δέ τε ἄστυ φάτ᾽ εἶναι.

So he spoke, and Telemachus passed out through the farmstead with rapid strides, and was sowing the seeds of evil for the wooers. But when he came to the stately house he set his spear in place, leaning it against a tall pillar,"
17,30,34,"αὐτὸς δ᾽ εἴσω ἴεν καὶ ὑπέρβη λάϊνον οὐδόν.

Him the nurse Eurycleia was far the first to see, as she was spreading fleeces on the richly-wrought chairs. With a burst of tears she came straight toward him, and round about them gathered the other maids of Odysseus of the steadfast heart,"

Then forth from her chamber came wise Penelope, like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite, and bursting into tears she flung her arms about her dear son, and kissed his head and both his beautiful eyes;"

“Thou art come, Telemachus, sweet light of my eyes; I thought I should never see thee more after thou hadst gone in thy ship to Pylos—secretly, and in my despite, to seek tidings of thy dear father. Come, then, tell me what sight thou hadst of him.”"

So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged. Then she bathed and took clean raiment for her body, and vowed to all the gods that she would offer hecatombs"

ἔστιν, ἀτὰρ μνηστῆρσι κακὸν πάντεσσι φυτεύει:","Be my witness Zeus above all gods, and this hospitable board and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come, that verily Odysseus is even now in his native land, resting or moving, learning of these evil deeds, and he is sowing the seeds of evil for all the wooers."
17,160,164,"τοῖον ἐγὼν οἰωνὸν ἐϋσσέλμου ἐπὶ νηὸς
ἥμενος ἐφρασάμην καὶ Τηλεμάχῳ ἐγεγώνευν.
τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:
αἲ γὰρ τοῦτο, ξεῖνε, ἔπος τετελεσμένον εἴη:
τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα","So plain a bird of omen did I mark as I sat on the benched ship, and I declared it to Telemachus.”
Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled. Then shouldest thou straightway know of kindness and many a gift"
17,165,165,"ἐξ ἐμεῦ,  ὡς ἄν τίς σε συναντόμενος μακαρίζοι.","from me, so that one who met thee would call the blessed.”"
17,166,169,"ὣς οἱ μὲν τοιαῦτα πρὸς ἀλλήλους ἀγόρευον,
μνηστῆρες δὲ πάροιθεν Ὀδυσσῆος μεγάροιο
δίσκοισιν τέρποντο καὶ αἰγανέῃσιν ἱέντες,
ἐν τυκτῷ δαπέδῳ, ὅθι περ πάρος ὕβριν ἔχοντες.","
Thus they spoke to one another. And the wooers meanwhile in front of the palace of Odysseus were making merry, throwing the discus and the javelin in a levelled place, as their wont was, in insolence of heart."
17,170,174,"ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ δείπνηστος ἔην καὶ ἐπήλυθε μῆλα
πάντοθεν ἐξ ἀγρῶν, οἱ δ᾽ ἤγαγον οἳ τὸ πάρος περ,
καὶ τότε δή σφιν ἔειπε Μέδων: ὃς γάρ ῥα μάλιστα
ἥνδανε κηρύκων, καὶ σφιν παρεγίγνετο δαιτί:
κοῦροι, ἐπεὶ δὴ πάντες ἐτέρφθητε φρέν᾽ ἀέθλοις,","But when it was the hour for dinner, and the flocks came in from all sides from the fields, and the men led them who were wont to lead, then Medon, who of all the heralds was most to their liking and was ever present at their feasts, spoke to them, saying:
“Youths, now that you have all made glad your hearts with sport,"
17,175,179,"ἔρχεσθε πρὸς δώμαθ᾽,  ἵν᾽ ἐντυνώμεθα δαῖτα:

αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ᾽ ἵκοντο δόμους εὖ ναιετάοντας,
χλαίνας μὲν κατέθεντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε,","come to the house that we may make ready a feast; for it is no bad thing to take one's dinner in season.”
So he spoke, and they rose up and went, and hearkened to his word. And when they had come to the stately house they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,"
17,180,184,"οἱ δ᾽ ἱέρευον ὄϊς μεγάλους καὶ πίονας αἶγας,

But Odysseus and the goodly swineherd were making haste to go from the field to the city; and the swineherd, a leader of men, spoke first, and said:
"
17,185,189,"ξεῖν᾽,  ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ἔπειτα πόλινδ᾽ ἰέναι μενεαίνεις

17,190,194,"ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε νῦν ἴομεν: δὴ γὰρ μέμβλωκε μάλιστα

ἀλλ᾽ ἴομεν, σὺ δ᾽ ἔπειτα διαμπερὲς ἡγεμόνευε.","come now, let us go. The day is far spent, and soon thou wilt find it colder toward evening.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “I see, I give heed; this thou biddest one with understanding. Come, let us go, and be thou my guide all the way."
17,195,199,"δὸς δέ μοι,  εἴ ποθί τοι ῥόπαλον τετμημένον ἐστίν,

Εὔμαιος δ᾽ ἄρα οἱ σκῆπτρον θυμαρὲς ἔδωκε.","But give me a staff to lean upon, if thou hast one cut anywhere, for verily ye said that the way was treacherous.” 
He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, slung by a twisted cord, and Eumaeus gave him a staff to his liking."
17,200,203,"τὼ βήτην,  σταθμὸν δὲ κύνες καὶ βώτορες ἄνδρες

17,204,204,ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ στείχοντες ὁδὸν κάτα παιπαλόεσσαν,"
But when, as they went along the rugged path,"
17,205,209,"ἄστεος ἐγγὺς ἔσαν καὶ ἐπὶ κρήνην ἀφίκοντο

17,215,219,"τοὺς δὲ ἰδὼν νείκεσσεν ἔπος τ᾽ ἔφατ᾽ ἔκ τ᾽ ὀνόμαζεν,

“Lo, now, in very truth the vile leads the vile. As ever, the god is bringing like and like together. Whither, pray, art thou leading this filthy wretch, thou miserable swineherd,"
17,220,224,"πτωχὸν ἀνιηρόν δαιτῶν ἀπολυμαντῆρα;

But since he has learned only deeds of evil, he will not care to busy himself with work, but is minded rather to go skulking through the land, that by begging he may feed his insatiate belly. But I will speak out to thee, and this word shall verily be brought to pass."
17,230,234,"αἴ κ᾽ ἔλθῃ πρὸς δώματ᾽ Ὀδυσσῆος θείοιο,

So he spoke, and as he passed he kicked Odysseus on the hip in his folly, yet he did not drive him from the path,"
17,235,239,"ἀλλ᾽ ἔμεν᾽ ἀσφαλέως: ὁ δὲ μερμήριξεν Ὀδυσσεὺς

And Odysseus pondered whether he should leap upon him and take his life with his staff, or seize him round about, and lift him up, and dash his head upon the ground. Yet he endured, and stayed him from his purpose. And the swineherd looked the man in the face, and rebuked him, and lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud:
"

Then Melanthius, the goatherd, answered him: “Lo now, how the cur talks, his mind full of mischief. Him will I some day"

Would that Apollo, of the silver bow, might smite Telemachus to-day in the halls, or that he might be slain by the wooers, as surely as for Odysseus in a far land the day of return has been lost.”
So saying, he left them there, as they walked slowly on,"

Then by him those that served set a portion of meat, and the grave housewife brought and set before him bread,"

“Eumaeus, surely this is the beautiful house of Odysseus."

To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Easily hast thou marked it, for in all things thou art ready of wit. But come, let us take thought how these things shall be."

καὶ κρέας, ὥς οἱ χεῖρες ἐχάνδανον ἀμφιβαλόντι:","leaning against a post of cypress wood, which of old a carpenter had skilfully planed, and made straight to the line. Then Telemachus called the swineherd to him, and, taking a whole loaf from out the beautiful basket, and all the meat his hands could hold in their grasp, spoke to him saying:
"
17,345,349,"δὸς τῷ ξείνῳ ταῦτα φέρων αὐτόν τε κέλευε
αἰτίζειν μάλα πάντας ἐποιχόμενον μνηστῆρας:
αἰδὼς δ᾽ οὐκ ἀγαθὴ κεχρημένῳ ἀνδρὶ παρεῖναι.
ὣς φάτο, βῆ δὲ συφορβός, ἐπεὶ τὸν μῦθον ἄκουσεν,
ἀγχοῦ δ᾽ ἱστάμενος ἔπεα πτερόεντ᾽ ἀγόρευε:","“Take, and give this mess to yon stranger, and bid him go about himself and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame is no good comrade for a man that is in need.”
So he spoke, and the swineherd went, when he had heard this saying, and coming up to Odysseus spoke to him winged words:
"
17,350,354,"Τηλέμαχός τοι,  ξεῖνε, διδοῖ τάδε, καί σε κελεύει
αἰτίζειν μάλα πάντας ἐποιχόμενον μνηστῆρας:
αἰδῶ δ᾽ οὐκ ἀγαθήν φησ᾽ ἔμμεναι ἀνδρὶ προΐκτῃ.
τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:
Ζεῦ ἄνα, Τηλέμαχόν μοι ἐν ἀνδράσιν ὄλβιον εἶναι,","“Stranger, Telemachus gives thee these, and bids thee go about and beg of the wooers one and all. Shame, he says, is no good thing in a beggar man.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said, “King Zeus, grant, I pray thee, that Telemachus may be blest among men,"
17,355,359,"καί οἱ πάντα γένοιθ᾽ ὅσσα φρεσὶν ᾗσι μενοινᾷ.
ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφοτέρῃσιν ἐδέξατο καὶ κατέθηκεν
αὖθι ποδῶν προπάροιθεν, ἀεικελίης ἐπὶ πήρης,
ἤσθιε δ᾽ ἧος ἀοιδὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄειδεν:
εὖθ᾽ ὁ δεδειπνήκειν, ὁ δ᾽ ἐπαύετο θεῖος ἀοιδός.","and may have all that his heart desires.”
He spoke, and took the mess in both his hands and set it down there before his feet on his miserable wallet. Then he ate so long as the minstrel sang in the halls. But when he had dined and the divine minstrel was ceasing to sing,"
17,360,364,"μνηστῆρες δ᾽ ὁμάδησαν ἀνὰ μέγαρ᾽.  αὐτὰρ Ἀθήνη,
ἄγχι παρισταμένη Λαερτιάδην Ὀδυσῆα
ὤτρυν᾽, ὡς ἂν πύρνα κατὰ μνηστῆρας ἀγείροι,
γνοίη θ᾽ οἵ τινές εἰσιν ἐναίσιμοι οἵ τ᾽ ἀθέμιστοι:
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὥς τιν᾽ ἔμελλ᾽ ἀπαλεξήσειν κακότητος.","the wooers broke into uproar throughout the halls; but Athena drew close to the side of Odysseus, son of Laertes, and roused him to go among the wooers and gather bits of bread, and learn which of them were righteous and which lawless. Yet even so she was not minded to save one of them from ruin."
17,365,369,"βῆ δ᾽ ἴμεν αἰτήσων ἐνδέξια φῶτα ἕκαστον,
πάντοσε χεῖρ᾽ ὀρέγων, ὡς εἰ πτωχὸς πάλαι εἴη.
οἱ δ᾽ ἐλεαίροντες δίδοσαν, καὶ ἐθάμβεον αὐτόν,
ἀλλήλους τ᾽ εἴροντο τίς εἴη καὶ πόθεν ἔλθοι.
τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν:","So he set out to beg of every man, beginning on the right, stretching out his hand on every side, as though he had been long a beggar. And they pitied him and gave, and marvelled at him, asking one another who he was and whence he came.
Then among them spoke Melanthius, the goatherd:"
17,370,374,"κέκλυτέ μευ,  μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης,
τοῦδε περὶ ξείνου: ἦ γάρ μιν πρόσθεν ὄπωπα.
ἦ τοι μέν οἱ δεῦρο συβώτης ἡγεμόνευεν,
αὐτὸν δ᾽ οὐ σάφα οἶδα, πόθεν γένος εὔχεται εἶναι.
ὣς ἔφατ᾽, Ἀντίνοος δ᾽ ἔπεσιν νείκεσσε συβώτην:","“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, regarding this stranger, for verily I have seen him before. Truly it was the swineherd that led him hither, but of the man himself I know not surely from whence he declares his birth to be.”
So he spoke, and Antinous rebuked the swineherd, saying:"
17,375,379,"ὦ ἀρίγνωτε συβῶτα,  τίη δὲ σὺ τόνδε πόλινδε
ἤγαγες; ἦ οὐχ ἅλις ἧμιν ἀλήμονές εἰσι καὶ ἄλλοι,
πτωχοὶ ἀνιηροί, δαιτῶν ἀπολυμαντῆρες;
ἦ ὄνοσαι ὅτι τοι βίοτον κατέδουσιν ἄνακτος
ἐνθάδ᾽ ἀγειρόμενοι, σὺ δὲ καὶ προτὶ τόνδ᾽ ἐκάλεσσας;","“Notorious swineherd, why, pray, didst thou bring this man to the city? Have we not vagabonds enough without him, nuisances of beggars to mar our feast? Dost thou not think it enough that they gather here and devour the substance of thy master, that thou dost bid this fellow too?”"
17,380,384,"τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφης,  Εὔμαιε συβῶτα:
Ἀντίνο᾽, οὐ μὲν καλὰ καὶ ἐσθλὸς ἐὼν ἀγορεύεις:

ἄλλον γ᾽, εἰ μὴ τῶν οἳ δημιοεργοὶ ἔασι,
μάντιν ἢ ἰητῆρα κακῶν ἢ τέκτονα δούρων,","To him then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “Antinous, no fair words are these thou speakest, noble though thou art. Who pray, of himself ever seeks out and bids a stranger from abroad, unless it be one of those that are masters of some public craft, a prophet, or a healer of ills, or a builder,"
17,385,389,"ἢ καὶ θέσπιν ἀοιδόν,  ὅ κεν τέρπῃσιν ἀείδων;

Yet a beggar would no man bid to be burden to himself. But thou art ever harsh above all the wooers to the slaves of Odysseus, and most of all to me; yet I"
17,390,394,"οὐκ ἀλέγω,  ἧός μοι ἐχέφρων Πηνελόπεια

Ἀντίνοος δ᾽ εἴωθε κακῶς ἐρεθιζέμεν αἰεὶ","care not, so long as my lady, the constant Penelope, lives in the hall, and godlike Telemachus.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Be silent: do not, I bid thee, answer yonder man with many words, for Antinous is wont ever in evil wise to provoke to anger"
17,395,399,"μύθοισιν χαλεποῖσιν,  ἐποτρύνει δὲ καὶ ἄλλους.
ἦ ῥα καὶ Ἀντίνοον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:
Ἀντίνο᾽, ἦ μευ καλὰ πατὴρ ὣς κήδεαι υἷος,
ὃς τὸν ξεῖνον ἄνωγας ἀπὸ μεγάροιο διέσθαι
μύθῳ ἀναγκαίῳ: μὴ τοῦτο θεὸς τελέσειε.","with harsh words, aye, and urges on the others too.”
With this he spoke winged words to Antinous: “Antinous, truly thou carest well for me, as a father for his son, seeing that thou biddest me drive yonder stranger from the hall with a word of compulsion. May the god never bring such a thing to pass."
17,400,404,"δός οἱ ἑλών: οὔ τοι φθονέω: κέλομαι γὰρ ἐγώ γε:

In this matter regard not my mother, no, nor any of the slaves that are in the house of divine Odysseus. But verily far other is the thought in thy breast; for thou art far more fain thyself to eat than to give to another.”
"
17,405,409,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Ἀντίνοος ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέειπε:

ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἔφη, καὶ θρῆνυν ἑλὼν ὑπέφηνε τραπέζης","Then Antinous answered him, and said: “Telemachus, thou braggart, unrestrained in daring, what a thing hast thou said! If all the wooers would but hand him as much as I, for full three months' space this house would keep him at a distance.”
So he spoke, and seized the footstool"
17,410,414,"κείμενον,  ᾧ ῥ᾽ ἔπεχεν λιπαροὺς πόδας εἰλαπινάζων:

But all the rest gave gifts, and filled the wallet with bread and bits of meat. And now Odysseus was like to have gone back again to the threshold, and to have made trial of the Achaeans without cost, but he paused by Antinous, and spoke to him, saying: 
"
17,415,419,"δός,  φίλος: οὐ μέν μοι δοκέεις ὁ κάκιστος Ἀχαιῶν

καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτε οἶκον ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔναιον","“Friend, give me some gift; thou seemest not in my eyes to be the basest of the Achaeans, but rather the noblest, for thou art like a king. Therefore it is meet that thou shouldest give even a better portion of bread than the rest; so would I make thy fame known all over the boundless earth. For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men,"
17,420,423,"ὄλβιος ἀφνειὸν καὶ πολλάκι δόσκον ἀλήτῃ,
τοίῳ ὁποῖος ἔοι καὶ ὅτευ κεχρημένος ἔλθοι:

17,424,424,ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ἀλάπαξε Κρονίων—ἤθελε γάρ που—,"
But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught—so, I ween, was his good pleasure—"
17,425,429,"ὅς μ᾽ ἅμα ληϊστῆρσι πολυπλάγκτοισιν ἀνῆκεν

αὐτοῦ πὰρ νήεσσι μένειν καὶ νῆας ἔρυσθαι,","who sent me forth with roaming pirates to go to Egypt, a far voyage, that I might meet my ruin; and in the river Aegyptus I moored my curved ships. Then verily I bade my trusty comrades to remain there by the ships and to guard the ships,"
17,430,434,"ὀπτῆρας δὲ κατὰ σκοπιὰς ὤτρυνα νέεσθαι.

πόρθεον, ἐκ δὲ γυναῖκας ἄγον καὶ νήπια τέκνα,
αὐτούς τ᾽ ἔκτεινον: τάχα δ᾽ ἐς πόλιν ἵκετ᾽ ἀϋτή.","and I sent out scouts to go to places of outlook. But my comrades, yielding to wantonness and led on by their own might, straightway set about wasting the fair fields of the men of Egypt; and they carried off the women and little children, and slew the men; and the cry came quickly to the city."
17,435,439,"οἱ δὲ βοῆς ἀΐοντες ἅμ᾽ ἠοῖ φαινομένηφιν
ἦλθον: πλῆτο δὲ πᾶν πεδίον πεζῶν τε καὶ ἵππων

στῆναι ἐναντίβιον: περὶ γὰρ κακὰ πάντοθεν ἔστη.","Then, hearing the shouting, the people came forth at break of day, and the whole plain was filled with footmen and chariots and the flashing of bronze. And Zeus, who hurls the thunderbolt, cast an evil panic upon my comrades, and none had courage to take his stand and face the foe; for evil surrounded us on every side."
17,440,444,"ἔνθ᾽ ἡμέων πολλοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτανον ὀξέϊ χαλκῷ,

ἔνθεν δὴ νῦν δεῦρο τόδ᾽ ἵκω πήματα πάσχων.","So then they slew many of us with the sharp bronze, and others they led up to their city alive, to work for them perforce. But they gave me to a friend who met them to take to Cyprus, even to Dmetor, son of Iasus, who ruled mightily over Cyprus; and from thence am I now come hither, sore distressed.”
"
17,445,449,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Ἀντίνοος ἀπαμείβετο φώνησέν τε:

στῆθ᾽ οὕτως ἐς μέσσον, ἐμῆς ἀπάνευθε τραπέζης,
μὴ τάχα πικρὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Κύπρον ἵκηαι:
ὥς τις θαρσαλέος καὶ ἀναιδής ἐσσι προΐκτης.","Then Antinous answered him, and said: “What god has brought this bane hither to trouble our feast? Stand off yonder in the midst, away from my table, lest thou come presently to a bitter Egypt and a bitter Cyprus, seeing that thou art a bold and shameless beggar."
17,450,454,"ἑξείης πάντεσσι παρίστασαι: οἱ δὲ διδοῦσι
μαψιδίως, ἐπεὶ οὔ τις ἐπίσχεσις οὐδ᾽ ἐλεητὺς
ἀλλοτρίων χαρίσασθαι, ἐπεὶ πάρα πολλὰ ἑκάστῳ.
τὸν δ᾽ ἀναχωρήσας προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:
ὢ πόποι, οὐκ ἄρα σοί γ᾽ ἐπὶ εἴδεϊ καὶ φρένες ἦσαν:","Thou comest up to every man in turn, and they give recklessly; for there is no restraint or scruple in giving freely of another's goods, since each man has plenty beside him.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles drew back, and said to him: “Lo, now, it seems that thou at least hast not wits to match thy beauty."
17,455,459,"οὐ σύ γ᾽ ἂν ἐξ οἴκου σῷ ἐπιστάτῃ οὐδ᾽ ἅλα δοίης,
ὃς νῦν ἀλλοτρίοισι παρήμενος οὔ τί μοι ἔτλης
σίτου ἀποπροελὼν δόμεναι: τὰ δὲ πολλὰ πάρεστιν.
ὣς ἔφατ᾽, Ἀντίνοος δ᾽ ἐχολώσατο κηρόθι μᾶλλον,
καί μιν ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:","Thou wouldest not out of thine own substance give even a grain of salt to thy suppliant, thou who now, when sitting at another's table, hadst not the heart to take of the bread and give me aught. Yet here lies plenty at thy hand.”
So he spoke, and Antinous waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
"
17,460,461,"νῦν δή σ᾽ οὐκέτι καλὰ διὲκ μεγάροιό γ᾽ ὀΐω
ἂψ ἀναχωρήσειν, ὅτε δὴ καὶ ὀνείδεα βάζεις.","“Now verily, methinks, thou shalt no more go forth from the hall in seemly fashion, since thou dost even utter words of reviling.”"
17,462,464,"ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἔφη, καὶ θρῆνυν ἑλὼν βάλε δεξιὸν ὦμον,
πρυμνότατον κατὰ νῶτον: ὁ δ᾽ ἐστάθη ἠΰτε πέτρη
ἔμπεδον, οὐδ᾽ ἄρα μιν σφῆλεν βέλος Ἀντινόοιο,","
So saying, he seized the footstool and flung it, and struck Odysseus on the base of the right shoulder, where it joins the back. But he stood firm as a rock, nor did the missile of Antinous make him reel;"
17,465,469,"ἀλλ᾽ ἀκέων κίνησε κάρη,  κακὰ βυσσοδομεύων.
ἂψ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπ᾽ οὐδὸν ἰὼν κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζετο, κὰδ δ᾽ ἄρα πήρην

κέκλυτέ μευ, μνηστῆρες ἀγακλειτῆς βασιλείης,
ὄφρ᾽ εἴπω τά με θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι κελεύει.","but he shook his head in silence, pondering evil in the deep of his heart. Then back to the threshold he went and sat down, and down he laid his well-filled wallet; and he spoke among the wooers: 
“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me."
17,470,474,"οὐ μὰν οὔτ᾽ ἄχος ἐστὶ μετὰ φρεσὶν οὔτε τι πένθος,

οὐλομένης, ἣ πολλὰ κάκ᾽ ἀνθρώποισι δίδωσιν.","Verily there is no pain of heart nor any grief when a man is smitten while fighting for his own possessions, whether for his cattle or for his white sheep; but Antinous has smitten me for my wretched belly's sake, an accursed plague that brings many evils upon men."
17,475,479,"ἀλλ᾽ εἴ που πτωχῶν γε θεοὶ καὶ Ἐρινύες εἰσίν,

Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, answered him: “Sit still, and eat, stranger, or go elsewhere; lest the young men drag thee"
17,480,484,"ἢ ποδὸς ἢ καὶ χειρός,  ἀποδρύψωσι δὲ πάντα.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ὑπερφιάλως νεμέσησαν:

οὐλόμεν᾽, εἰ δή πού τις ἐπουράνιος θεός ἐστιν.","by hand or foot through the house for words like these, and strip off all thy skin.”
So he spoke, but they all were filled with exceeding indignation, and thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Antinous, thou didst not well to strike the wretched wanderer. Doomed man that thou art, what if haply he be some god come down from heaven!"
17,485,489,"καί τε θεοὶ ξείνοισιν ἐοικότες ἀλλοδαποῖσι,

Τηλέμαχος δ᾽ ἐν μὲν κραδίῃ μέγα πένθος ἄεξε","Aye, and the gods in the guise of strangers from afar put on all manner of shapes, and visit the cities, beholding the violence and the righteousness of men.”
So spoke the wooers, but Antinous paid no heed to their words. And Telemachus nursed in his heart great grief"
17,490,494,"βλημένου, οὐδ᾽ ἄρα δάκρυ χαμαὶ βάλεν ἐκ βλεφάροιϊν,

Howbeit when wise Penelope heard of the man's being smitten in the hall, she spoke among her handmaids, and said: “Even so may thine own self be smitten by the famed archer Apollo.” 
"
17,495,499,"τὴν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν:

And wise Penelope answered her: “Nurse, enemies are they all, for they devise evil."
17,500,504,"Ἀντίνοος δὲ μάλιστα μελαίνῃ κηρὶ ἔοικε.

Some wretched stranger roams through the house, begging alms of the men, for want compels him, and all the others filled his wallet and gave him gifts, but Antinous flung a footstool and smote him at the base of the right shoulder.”"
17,505,509,"ἡ μὲν ἄρ᾽ ὣς ἀγόρευε μετὰ δμῳῇσι γυναιξίν,

“Go, goodly Eumaeus, and bid the stranger come hither, that I may give him greeting, and ask him"

To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer, and say: “I would, O queen, that the Achaeans would keep silence, for he speaks such words as would charm thy very soul."

Then wise Penelope answered him: “Go, call him hither, that he may himself tell me to my face."
17,530,534,"οὗτοι δ᾽ ἠὲ θύρῃσι καθήμενοι ἑψιαάσθων.

For their own possessions lie untouched in their homes, bread and sweet wine, and on these do their servants feed. But themselves throng our house day after day,"
17,535,539,"βοῦς ἱερεύοντες καὶ ὄϊς καὶ πίονας αἶγας,

But if Odysseus should come and return to his native land,"
17,540,544,"αἶψά κε σὺν ᾧ παιδὶ βίας ἀποτίσεται ἀνδρῶν.

So she spoke, and Telemachus sneezed loudly, and all the room round about echoed wondrously. And Penelope laughed, and straightway spoke to Eumaeus winged words:
“Go, pray, call the stranger here before me."
17,545,549,"οὐχ ὁράᾳς ὅ μοι υἱὸς ἐπέπταρε πᾶσιν ἔπεσσι;

Therefore shall utter death fall upon the wooers one and all, nor shall one of them escape death and the fates. And another thing will I tell thee, and do thou lay it to heart. If I find that he speaks all things truly,"
17,550,554,"ἕσσω μιν χλαῖνάν τε χιτῶνά τε,  εἵματα καλά.

So she spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying; and coming up to Odysseus he spoke to him winged words: 
“Sir stranger, wise Penelope calls for thee, the mother of Telemachus, and her heart"
17,555,559,"ἀμφὶ πόσει κέλεται,  καὶ κήδεά περ πεπαθυίῃ.

For well do I know of Odysseus, and in common have we borne affliction. But I have fear of this throng of harsh wooers,"

So he spoke, and the swineherd went when he had heard this saying."

“Thou dost not bring him, Eumaeus. What does the wanderer mean by this? Does he fear some one beyond measure, or does he idly feel ashamed in the house? 'Tis ill for a beggar to feel shame.”
To her, then, swineherd Eumaeus, didst thou make answer and say:"
17,580,584,"μυθεῖται κατὰ μοῖραν,  ἅ πέρ κ᾽ οἴοιτο καὶ ἄλλος,

So she spoke, and the goodly swineherd departed"

“Friend, I am going forth to guard the swine and all things there, thy livelihood and mine; but have thou charge of all things here."
17,595,599,"αὐτὸν μέν σε πρῶτα σάω,  καὶ φράζεο θυμῷ

Then wise Telemachus answered him: “So shall it be, father; go thy way when thou hast supped."

So he spoke, and the swineherd sat down again on the polished chair. But when he had satisfied his heart with meat and drink, he went his way to the swine, and left the courts and the hall"

18,5,9,"Ἀρναῖος δ᾽ ὄνομ᾽ ἔσκε: τὸ γὰρ θέτο πότνια μήτηρ

He came now, and was for driving Odysseus from his own house; and he began to revile him, and spoke winged words:

Dost thou not see that all men are winking at me, and bidding me drag thee? Yet for myself, I am ashamed to do it. Nay, up with thee, lest our quarrel even come to blows.”
Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered him:"
18,15,19,"δαιμόνι᾽,  οὔτε τί σε ῥέζω κακὸν οὔτ᾽ ἀγορεύω,
οὔτε τινὰ φθονέω δόμεναι καὶ πόλλ᾽ ἀνελόντα.

This threshold will hold us both, and thou hast no need to be jealous for the goods of other folk. Thou seemest to me to be a vagrant, even as I am; and as for happy fortune, it is the gods that are like to give us that."
18,20,24,"χερσὶ δὲ μή τι λίην προκαλίζεο,  μή με χολώσῃς,

So should I have the greater peace tomorrow, for I deem not that thou shalt return a second time to the hall of Odysseus, son of Laertes.”
"
18,25,29,"τὸν δὲ χολωσάμενος προσεφώνεεν Ἶρος ἀλήτης:

But I will devise evil for him, smiting him left and right, and will scatter on the ground all the teeth from his jaws, as though he were a swine wasting the corn."
18,30,34,"ζῶσαι νῦν,  ἵνα πάντες ἐπιγνώωσι καὶ οἵδε

Thus on the polished threshold before the lofty doors they stirred one another's rage right heartily. And the strong and mighty Antinous heard the two,"
18,35,39,"ἡδὺ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐκγελάσας μετεφώνει μνηστήρεσσιν:

“Friends, never before has such a thing come to pass, that a god has brought sport like this to this house. Yon stranger and Irus are provoking one another to blows. Come, let us quickly set them on.”
"
18,40,44,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽,  οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ἀνήϊξαν γελόωντες,

“Hear me, ye proud wooers, that I may say somewhat. Here at the fire are goats' paunches lying, which"

Now whichever of the two wins and proves himself the better man, let him rise and choose for himself which one of these he will. And furthermore he shall always feast with us, nor will we suffer any other beggar to join our company and beg of us.”"
18,50,54,"ὣς ἔφατ᾽ Ἀντίνοος,  τοῖσιν δ᾽ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος.

“Friends, in no wise may an old man that is overcome with woe fight with a younger. Howbeit my belly, that worker of evil, urges me on, that I may be overcome by his blows."
18,55,59,"ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε νῦν μοι πάντες ὀμόσσατε καρτερὸν ὅρκον,

So he spoke, and they all gave the oath not to smite him, even as he bade. But when they had sworn and made an end of the oath,"

So he spoke, and they all praised his words. But Odysseus girded his rags about his loins and showed his thighs, comely and great, and his broad shoulders came to view, and his chest and mighty arms. And Athena"

So he spoke, and thereat yet greater trembling seized the other's limbs, and they led him into the ring and both men put up their hands."

μηδὲ σύ γε ξείνων καὶ πτωχῶν κοίρανος εἶναι
λυγρὸς ἐών, μή πού τι κακὸν καὶ μεῖζον ἐπαύρῃ.
ἦ ῥα καὶ ἀμφ᾽ ὤμοισιν ἀεικέα βάλλετο πήρην,
πυκνὰ ῥωγαλέην: ἐν δὲ στρόφος ἦεν ἀορτήρ.","“Sit there now, and scare off swine and dogs, and do not thou be lord of strangers and beggars, miserable that thou art, lest haply thou meet with some worse thing to profit withal.”
He spoke, and flung about his shoulders his miserable wallet, full of holes, and slung by a twisted cord."
18,110,114,"ἂψ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπ᾽ οὐδὸν ἰὼν κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζετο: τοὶ δ᾽ ἴσαν εἴσω

ὃς τοῦτον τὸν ἄναλτον ἀλητεύειν ἀπέπαυσας","Then back to the threshold he went and sat down; and the wooers went within, laughing merrily, and they greeted him, saying:
“May Zeus grant thee, stranger, and the other immortal gods what thou desirest most, and the dearest wish of thy heart, seeing that thou hast made this insatiate fellow to cease from begging"
18,115,119,"ἐν δήμῳ: τάχα γάρ μιν ἀνάξομεν ἤπειρόνδε

So they spoke, and goodly Odysseus was glad at the word of omen. And Antinous set before him the great paunch, filled with fat and blood, and Amphinomus"
18,120,123,"ἄρτους ἐκ κανέοιο δύω παρέθηκεν ἀείρας

“Hail, Sir stranger; may happy fortune be thine in time to come, though now thou art the thrall of many sorrows.”"
18,124,124,τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:,"
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said:"
18,125,129,"Ἀμφίνομ᾽,  ἦ μάλα μοι δοκέεις πεπνυμένος εἶναι:

From him, they say, thou art sprung, and thou seemest a man soft of speech. Wherefore I will tell thee, and do thou give heed and hearken."
18,130,134,"οὐδὲν ἀκιδνότερον γαῖα τρέφει ἀνθρώποιο,
πάντων ὅσσα τε γαῖαν ἔπι πνείει τε καὶ ἕρπει.
οὐ μὲν γάρ ποτέ φησι κακὸν πείσεσθαι ὀπίσσω,

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ καὶ λυγρὰ θεοὶ μάκαρες τελέσωσι,","Nothing feebler does earth nurture than man, of all things that on earth are breathing and moving. For he thinks that he will never suffer evil in time to come, so long as the gods give him prosperity and his knees are quick; but when again the blessed gods decree him sorrow,"
18,135,139,"καὶ τὰ φέρει ἀεκαζόμενος τετληότι θυμῷ:

For I, too, was once like to be prosperous among men, but many deeds of wantonness I wrought, yielding to my might and my strength,"
18,140,144,"πατρί τ᾽ ἐμῷ πίσυνος καὶ ἐμοῖσι κασιγνήτοισι.

18,145,149,"ἀνδρός,  ὃν οὐκέτι φημὶ φίλων καὶ πατρίδος αἴης

But may some god lead thee forth hence to thy home, and mayest thou not meet him when he comes home to his dear native land. For not without bloodshed, methinks,"
18,150,154,"μνηστῆρας καὶ κεῖνον,  ἐπεί κε μέλαθρον ὑπέλθῃ.

So he spoke, and pouring a libation, drank of the honey-sweet wine, and then gave back the cup into the hands of the marshaller of the people. But Amphinomus went through the hall with a heavy heart, bowing his head; for his spirit boded bane."
18,155,159,"ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς φύγε κῆρα: πέδησε δὲ καὶ τὸν Ἀθήνη

Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, put it in the heart of the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope,"
18,160,164,"μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι,  ὅπως πετάσειε μάλιστα

“Eurynome, my heart longs, though it has never longed before,"
18,165,168,"μνηστήρεσσι φανῆναι,  ἀπεχθομένοισί περ ἔμπης:

18,169,169,τὴν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Εὐρυνόμη ταμίη πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπεν:,"
Then the housewife, Eurynome, spoke to her and said:"
18,170,174,"ναὶ δὴ ταῦτά γε πάντα,  τέκος, κατὰ μοῖραν ἔειπες.

Go, then, reveal thy word to thy son and hide it not; but first wash thy body and anoint thy face, and go not as thou art with both cheeks stained with tears. Go, for it is ill to grieve ever without ceasing."
18,175,179,"ἤδη μὲν γάρ τοι παῖς τηλίκος,  ὃν σὺ μάλιστα

Then wise Penelope answered her again: “Eurynome, beguile me not thus in thy love to wash my body and anoint me with oil."
18,180,184,"ἀγλαΐην γὰρ ἐμοί γε θεοί,  τοὶ Ὄλυμπον ἔχουσιν,

But bid Autonoe and Hippodameia come to me, that they may stand by my side in the hall. Alone I will not go among men, for I am ashamed.”
"
18,185,189,"ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἔφη,  γρηῢς δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει

Then again the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, took other counsel. On the daughter of Icarius she shed sweet sleep, and she leaned back and slept"
18,190,194,"αὐτοῦ ἐνὶ κλιντῆρι: τέως δ᾽ ἄρα δῖα θεάων

And meanwhile the fair goddess was giving her immortal gifts, that the Achaeans might marvel at her. With balm she first made fair her beautiful face, with balm ambrosial, such as that wherewith Cytherea, of the fair crown, anoints herself when she goes into the lovely dance of the Graces;"
18,195,199,"καί μιν μακροτέρην καὶ πάσσονα θῆκεν ἰδέσθαι,

Now when she had done this the fair goddess departed, and the white-armed handmaids came forth from the chamber and drew near with sound of talking. Then sweet sleep released Penelope,"
18,200,204,"καί ῥ᾽ ἀπομόρξατο χερσὶ παρειὰς φώνησέν τε:

“Ah, in my utter wretchedness soft slumber enfolded me. Would that pure Artemis would even now give so soft a death, that I might no more waste my life away with sorrow at heart, longing for"
18,205,205,"παντοίην ἀρετήν,  ἐπεὶ ἔξοχος ἦεν Ἀχαιῶν.","the manifold excellence of my dear husband, for that he was pre-eminent among the Achaeans.”"
18,206,209,"ὣς φαμένη κατέβαιν᾽ ὑπερώϊα σιγαλόεντα,

So saying, she went down from the bright upper chamber, not alone, for two handmaids attended her. Now when the fair lady reached the wooers she stood by the doorpost of the well-built hall,"
18,210,214,"ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα:

Straightway then the knees of the wooers were loosened and their hearts enchanted with love, and they all prayed, each that he might lie by her side. But she spoke to Telemachus, her dear son:
"
18,215,219,"Τηλέμαχ᾽,  οὐκέτι τοι φρένες ἔμπεδοι οὐδὲ νόημα:

When thou wast but a child thou wast wont to revolve in thy mind thoughts more cunning; but now that thou art grown and hast reached the bounds of manhood, and wouldest be called a rich man's son by one who looked only to thy stature and thy comeliness, being himself a stranger from afar,"
18,220,224,"οὐκέτι τοι φρένες εἰσὶν ἐναίσιμοι οὐδὲ νόημα.

What a thing is this that has been done in these halls, that thou hast suffered yon stranger to be so maltreated! How now, if the stranger, while sitting thus in our house, should come to some harm through grievous mishandling?"
18,225,229,"σοί κ᾽ αἶσχος λώβη τε μετ᾽ ἀνθρώποισι πέλοιτο.

Then wise Telemachus answered her: “My mother, in this matter I take it not ill that thou art filled with anger. Yet of myself I know in my heart and understand each thing, the good and the evil, whereas heretofore I was but a child."
18,230,234,"ἀλλά τοι οὐ δύναμαι πεπνυμένα πάντα νοῆσαι:

Howbeit, I can tell thee, this battle between the stranger and Irus fell not out according to the mind of the wooers, but the stranger proved the better man."
18,235,239,"αἲ γάρ,  Ζεῦ τε πάτερ καὶ Ἀθηναίη καὶ Ἄπολλον,

18,240,244,"ἧσται νευστάζων κεφαλῇ,  μεθύοντι ἐοικώς,

Εὐρύμαχος δ᾽ ἐπέεσσι προσηύδα Πηνελόπειαν:","hanging his head like a drunken man, and cannot stand erect upon his feet, or go home to whatsoever place he is wont to go, because his limbs are loosened.”
Thus they spoke to one another. But Eurymachus addressed Penelope, and said:
"
18,245,249,"κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο,  περίφρον Πηνελόπεια,

18,250,254,"τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:

If he might but come and watch over this life of mine,"
18,255,259,"μεῖζόν κε κλέος εἴη ἐμὸν καὶ κάλλιον οὕτως.

“‘Wife, I deem not that the well-greaved Achaeans"
18,260,264,"ἐκ Τροίης εὖ πάντας ἀπήμονας ἀπονέεσθαι:

Be mindful of my father and my mother in the halls even as thou art now, or yet more, while I am far away. But when thou shalt see my son a bearded man,"
18,270,274,"γήμασθ᾽ ᾧ κ᾽ ἐθέλῃσθα,  τεὸν κατὰ δῶμα λιποῦσα.

“So he spoke, and now all this is being brought to pass. The night shall come when a hateful marriage shall fall to the lot of me accursed, whose happiness Zeus has taken away. But herein has bitter grief come upon my heart and soul,"
18,275,279,"μνηστήρων οὐχ ἥδε δίκη τὸ πάροιθε τέτυκτο:

They who are fain to woo a lady of worth and the daughter of a rich man and vie with one another, these bring of themselves cattle and goodly flocks, a banquet for the friends of the bride, and give to her glorious gifts;"
18,280,284,"ἀλλ᾽ οὐκ ἀλλότριον βίοτον νήποινον ἔδουσιν.

So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad, because she drew from them gifts, and beguiled their souls with gentle words, but her mind was set on other things.
Then Antinous, son of Eupeithes, spoke to her again, and said:"
18,285,289,"κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο,  περίφρον Πηνελόπεια,

But for us, we will go neither to our lands nor elsewhither, until thou weddest him whosoever is best of the Achaeans.”"
18,290,294,"ὣς ἔφατ᾽ Ἀντίνοος,  τοῖσιν δ᾽ ἐπιήνδανε μῦθος:

18,295,299,"ὅρμον δ᾽ Εὐρυμάχῳ πολυδαίδαλον αὐτίκ᾽ ἔνεικε.
χρύσεον, ἠλέκτροισιν ἐερμένον ἠέλιον ὥς.

ἐκ δ᾽ ἄρα Πεισάνδροιο Πολυκτορίδαο ἄνακτος","And a chain did another straightway bring to Eurymachus, one cunningly wrought of gold, strung with amber beads, bright as the sun. A pair of earrings his squires brought to Eurydamas, with three clustering drops, and great grace shone therefrom. And out of the house of lord Peisander, son of Polyctor,"
18,300,304,"ἴσθμιον ἤνεικεν θεράπων,  περικαλλὲς ἄγαλμα.

But the wooers"
18,305,309,"τρεψάμενοι τέρποντο,  μένον δ᾽ ἐπὶ ἕσπερον ἐλθεῖν.

Presently they set up three braziers in the hall to give them light, and round about them placed dry faggots, long since seasoned and hard, and newly split with the axe;"
18,310,314,"καὶ δαΐδας μετέμισγον: ἀμοιβηδὶς δ᾽ ἀνέφαινον

“Maidens of Odysseus, that has long been gone, go to the chambers where your honored queen abides,"
18,315,319,"τῇ δὲ παρ᾽ ἠλάκατα στροφαλίζετε,  τέρπετε δ᾽ αὐτὴν

For if they wish to wait for fair-throned Dawn, they shall in no wise outdo me. I am one that can endure much.”
"
18,320,324,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽,  αἱ δ᾽ ἐγέλασσαν, ἐς ἀλλήλας δὲ ἴδοντο.

And fair-cheeked Melantho rated him shamefully, Melantho, whom Dolius begot, but whom Penelope had reared and cherished as her own child, and gave her playthings to her heart's desire. Yet even so she had at heart no sorrow for Penelope,"
18,325,329,"ἀλλ᾽ ἥ γ᾽ Εὐρυμάχῳ μισγέσκετο καὶ φιλέεσκεν.

ἠέ που ἐς λέσχην, ἀλλ᾽ ἐνθάδε πόλλ᾽ ἀγορεύεις,","but she loved Eurymachus and was wont to lie with him. She then rated Odysseus with reviling words:
“Wretched stranger, thou art but a crack-brained fellow, unwilling to go to a smithy to sleep, or to a common lodge, but pratest here continually,"
18,330,334,"θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετ᾽ ἀνδράσιν,  οὐδέ τι θυμῷ

Surely wine has mastered thy wits, or else thy mind is ever thus, that thou dost babble idly. Art thou beside thyself because thou hast beaten that vagrant Irus? Beware, lest presently another better than Irus shall rise up against thee"
18,335,336,"ὅς τίς σ᾽ ἀμφὶ κάρη κεκοπὼς χερσὶ στιβαρῇσι

18,337,339,"τὴν δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Presently shall I go yonder, thou shameless thing, and tell Telemachus, since thou speakest thus, that on the spot he may cut thee limb from limb.”
"
18,340,344,"ὣς εἰπὼν ἐπέεσσι διεπτοίησε γυναῖκας.

But Odysseus took his stand by the burning braziers to give light, and looked upon all the men."
18,345,349,"ὥρμαινε φρεσὶν ᾗσιν,  ἅ ῥ᾽ οὐκ ἀτέλεστα γένοντο.

But Athena would in no wise suffer the proud wooers to abstain from bitter outrage, that pain might sink yet deeper into the heart of Odysseus, son of Laertes. So among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, began to speak,"
18,350,354,"κερτομέων Ὀδυσῆα: γέλω δ᾽ ἑτάροισιν ἔτευχε.

“Hear me, wooers of the glorious queen, that I may say what the heart in my breast bids me. Not without the will of the gods has this man come to the palace of Odysseus; in any case there is a glare of torches from him—"
18,355,359,"κὰκ κεφαλῆς,  ἐπεὶ οὔ οἱ ἔνι τρίχες οὐδ᾽ ἠβαιαί.

αἱμασιάς τε λέγων καὶ δένδρεα μακρὰ φυτεύων;","from his head, for there is no hair on it, no, not a trace.”
Therewith he called to Odysseus, sacker of cities: “Stranger, wouldest thou have a mind to serve for hire, if I should take thee into service on an outlying farm—thy pay shall be assured thee—gathering stones for walls, and planting tall trees?"
18,360,364,"ἔνθα κ᾽ ἐγὼ σῖτον μὲν ἐπηετανὸν παρέχοιμι,

But since thou hast learned only deeds of evil, thou wilt not care to busy thyself with work, but art minded rather to go skulking through the land, that thou mayest have wherewith to feed thy insatiate belly.”"
18,365,369,"τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

ἐν ποίῃ, δρέπανον μὲν ἐγὼν εὐκαμπὲς ἔχοιμι,
καὶ δὲ σὺ τοῖον ἔχοις, ἵνα πειρησαίμεθα ἔργου","Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Eurymachus, I would that we two might have a match in working in the season of spring, when the long days come, at mowing the grass, I with a curved scythe in my hands and thou with another like it,"
18,370,374,"νήστιες ἄχρι μάλα κνέφαος,  ποίη δὲ παρείη.

Or I would again that there were oxen to drive—the best there are, tawny and large, both well fed with grass, of like age and like power to bear the yoke, tireless in strength—and that there were a field of four acres, and the soil should yield before the plough:"
18,375,379,"τῷ κέ μ᾽ ἴδοις,  εἰ ὦλκα διηνεκέα προταμοίμην.

Or I would again that this day the son of Cronos might bring war upon us from whence he would, and I had a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, that fitted well my temples: then shouldest thou see me mingling amid the foremost fighters,"
18,380,384,"οὐδ᾽ ἄν μοι τὴν γαστέρ᾽ ὀνειδίζων ἀγορεύοις.

But right insolent art thou, and thy heart is cruel, and forsooth thou thinkest thyself to be some great man and mighty, because thou consortest with few men and weak. If but Odysseus might return, and come to his native land,"
18,385,389,"αἶψά κέ τοι τὰ θύρετρα,  καὶ εὐρέα περ μάλ᾽ ἐόντα,

ἆ δείλ᾽, ἦ τάχα τοι τελέω κακόν, οἷ᾽ ἀγορεύεις","soon would yonder doors, right wide though they are, prove all too narrow for thee in thy flight out through the doorway.”
So he spoke, and Eurymachus waxed the more wroth at heart, and with an angry glance from beneath his brows spoke to him winged words:
“Wretch, presently will I work thee evil, that thou pratest thus,"
18,390,393,"θαρσαλέως πολλοῖσι μετ᾽ ἀνδράσιν,  οὐδέ τι θυμῷ

18,394,394,ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας σφέλας ἔλλαβεν: αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς,"
So saying, he seized a footstool, but Odysseus"
18,395,399,"Ἀμφινόμου πρὸς γοῦνα καθέζετο Δουλιχιῆος,

And so Eurymachus struck a cup-bearer on the right hand, and the wine-jug fell to the ground with a clang, and the bearer groaned, and fell backwards in the dust. Then the wooers broke into uproar throughout the shadowy halls,"
18,400,404,"ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον:

νῦν δὲ περὶ πτωχῶν ἐριδαίνομεν, οὐδέ τι δαιτὸς
ἐσθλῆς ἔσσεται ἦδος, ἐπεὶ τὰ χερείονα νικᾷ.","and thus would one man speak with a glance at his neighbor: 
“Would that yon stranger had perished elsewhere on his wanderings or ever he came hither; then should he never have brought among us all this tumult. But now we are brawling about beggars, nor shall there be any joy in our rich feast, since worse things prevail.”
"
18,405,409,"τοῖσι δὲ καὶ μετέειφ᾽ ἱερὴ ἲς Τηλεμάχοιο

ἀλλ᾽ εὖ δαισάμενοι κατακείετε οἴκαδ᾽ ἰόντες,
ὁππότε θυμὸς ἄνωγε: διώκω δ᾽ οὔ τιν᾽ ἐγώ γε.","Then among them spoke the strong and mighty Telemachus: “Strange sirs, ye are mad, and no longer hide that ye have eaten and drunk; some god surely is moving you. Nay, now that you have well feasted, go to your homes and take your rest, when your spirits bid you. Yet do I drive no man forth.”
"
18,410,414,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες

Νίσου φαίδιμος υἱός, Ἀρητιάδαο ἄνακτος:
ὦ φίλοι, οὐκ ἂν δή τις ἐπὶ ῥηθέντι δικαίῳ","So he spoke, and they all bit their lips, and marvelled at Telemachus, that he spoke boldly. But Amphinomus spoke, and addressed them—he was son of the noble prince Nisus, son of Aretias:
“Friends, no man in answer to what has been fairly spoken"
18,415,419,"ἀντιβίοις ἐπέεσσι καθαπτόμενος χαλεπαίνοι:

Nay, come, let the bearer pour drops for libation in the cups, that we may pour libations, and go home to take our rest. As for this stranger,"
18,420,424,"τὸν ξεῖνον δὲ ἐῶμεν ἐνὶ μεγάροις Ὀδυσῆος

κῆρυξ Δουλιχιεύς: θεράπων δ᾽ ἦν Ἀμφινόμοιο:","let us leave him in the halls of Odysseus to be cared for by Telemachus; for to his house has he come.”
So said he, and the words that he spoke were pleasing to all. Then a bowl was mixed for them by the lord Mulius, a herald from Dulichium, who was squire to Amphinomus."
18,425,428,"νώμησεν δ᾽ ἄρα πᾶσιν ἐπισταδόν: οἱ δὲ θεοῖσι

Then when they had made libations and had drunk to their heart's content, they went their way, each man to his own house, to take their rest."
19,1,4,"αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,

Τηλέμαχε, χρὴ τεύχε᾽ ἀρήϊα κατθέμεν εἴσω","So goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers, and he straightway spoke winged words to Telemachus:
“Telemachus, the weapons of war thou must needs lay away within"
19,5,9,"πάντα μάλ᾽: αὐτὰρ μνηστῆρας μαλακοῖς ἐπέεσσι

19,10,14,"πρὸς δ᾽ ἔτι καὶ τόδε μεῖζον ἐνὶ φρεσὶν ἔβαλε δαίμων

For of itself does the iron draw a man to it.’” So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father,"
19,15,19,"ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν:

“Nurse, come now, I bid thee, shut up the women in their rooms, while I lay away in the store-room the weapons of my father, the goodly weapons which all uncared-for the smoke bedims in the hall since my father went forth, and I was still a child."
19,20,24,"νῦν δ᾽ ἐθέλω καταθέσθαι,  ἵν᾽ οὐ πυρὸς ἵξετ᾽ ἀϋτμή.

ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε, τίς τοι ἔπειτα μετοιχομένη φάος οἴσει;","But now I am minded to lay them away, where the breath of the fire will not come upon them.” 
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered him: “Aye, child, I would thou mightest ever take thought to care for the house and guard all its wealth. But come, who then shall fetch a light and bear it for thee,"
19,25,29,"δμῳὰς δ᾽ οὐκ εἴας προβλωσκέμεν,  αἵ κεν ἔφαινον.

ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἐφώνησεν, τῇ δ᾽ ἄπτερος ἔπλετο μῦθος.","since thou wouldest not suffer the maids, who might have given light, to go before thee?”
Then wise Telemachus answered her; “This stranger here; for I will suffer no man to be idle who touches my portion of meal, even though he has come from afar.”
So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged, and she locked the doors of the stately hall."
19,30,34,"κλήϊσεν δὲ θύρας μεγάρων εὖ ναιεταόντων.

19,35,39,"δὴ τότε Τηλέμαχος προσεφώνεεν ὃν πατέρ᾽ αἶψα:

“Father, verily this is a great marvel that my eyes behold; certainly the walls of the house and the fair beams and cross-beams of fir and the pillars that reach on high, glow in my eyes as with the light of blazing fire."
19,40,44,"ἦ μάλα τις θεὸς ἔνδον,  οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσι.

ἀλλὰ σὺ μὲν κατάλεξαι, ἐγὼ δ᾽ ὑπολείψομαι αὐτοῦ,","Surely some god is within, one of those who hold broad heaven.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Hush, check thy thought, and ask no question; this, I tell thee, is the way of the gods that hold Olympus. But do thou go and take thy rest and I will remain behind here,"
19,45,46,"ὄφρα κ᾽ ἔτι δμῳὰς καὶ μητέρα σὴν ἐρεθίζω:
ἡ δέ μ᾽ ὀδυρομένη εἰρήσεται ἀμφὶς ἕκαστα.",that I may stir yet more the minds of the maids and of thy mother; and she with weeping shall ask me of each thing separately.”
19,47,49,"ὣς φάτο, Τηλέμαχος δὲ διὲκ μεγάροιο βεβήκει

So he spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall by the light of blazing torches to go to his chamber to lie down, where he had heretofore been wont to rest, when sweet sleep came upon him."
19,50,54,"ἔνθ᾽ ἄρα καὶ τότ᾽ ἔλεκτο καὶ Ἠῶ δῖαν ἔμιμνεν.
αὐτὰρ ὁ ἐν μεγάρῳ ὑπελείπετο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
μνηστήρεσσι φόνον σὺν Ἀθήνῃ μερμηρίζων.
ἡ δ᾽ ἴεν ἐκ θαλάμοιο περίφρων Πηνελόπεια,
Ἀρτέμιδι ἰκέλη ἠὲ χρυσέῃ Ἀφροδίτῃ.","There now too he lay down and waited for the bright Dawn. But goodly Odysseus was left behind in the hall, planning with Athena's aid the slaying of the wooers.
Then wise Penelope came forth from her chamber like unto Artemis or golden Aphrodite,"
19,55,59,"τῇ παρὰ μὲν κλισίην πυρὶ κάτθεσαν,  ἔνθ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐφῖζε,
δινωτὴν ἐλέφαντι καὶ ἀργύρῳ: ἥν ποτε τέκτων
ποίησ᾽ Ἰκμάλιος, καὶ ὑπὸ θρῆνυν ποσὶν ἧκε

ἔνθα καθέζετ᾽ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια.","and for her they set by the fire, where she was wont to sit, a chair inlaid with spirals of ivory and silver, which of old the craftsman Icmalius had made, and had set beneath it a foot-stool for the feet, that was part of the chair, and upon it a great fleece was wont to be laid. On this then wise Penelope sat down,"
19,60,64,"ἦλθον δὲ δμῳαὶ λευκώλενοι ἐκ μεγάροιο.

πῦρ δ᾽ ἀπὸ λαμπτήρων χαμάδις βάλον, ἄλλα δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῶν
νήησαν ξύλα πολλά, φόως ἔμεν ἠδὲ θέρεσθαι.","and the white-armed maids came forth from the women's hall. These began to take away the abundant food, the tables, and the cups from which the lordly men had been drinking, and they cast the embers from the braziers on to the floor, and piled upon the braziers fresh logs in abundance, to give light and warmth.
"
19,65,69,"ἡ δ᾽ Ὀδυσῆ᾽ ἐνένιπε Μελανθὼ δεύτερον αὖτις:
ξεῖν᾽, ἔτι καὶ νῦν ἐνθάδ᾽ ἀνιήσεις διὰ νύκτα

ἀλλ᾽ ἔξελθε θύραζε, τάλαν, καὶ δαιτὸς ὄνησο:
ἢ τάχα καὶ δαλῷ βεβλημένος εἶσθα θύραζε.","But Melantho began again a second time to rate Odysseus, saying: “Stranger, wilt thou even now still be a plague to us through the night, roaming through the house, and wilt thou spy upon the women? Nay, get thee forth, thou wretch, and be content with thy supper, or straightway shalt thou even be smitten with a torch, and so go forth.”
"
19,70,74,"τὴν δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:
δαιμονίη,  τί μοι ὧδ᾽ ἐπέχεις κεκοτηότι θυμῷ;

πτωχεύω δ᾽ ἀνὰ δῆμον; ἀναγκαίη γὰρ ἐπείγει.
τοιοῦτοι πτωχοὶ καὶ ἀλήμονες ἄνδρες ἔασι","Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “Good woman, why, pray, dost thou thus assail me with angry heart? Is it because I am foul and wear mean raiment on my body, and beg through the land? Aye, for necessity compels me. Of such sort are beggars and vagabond folk."
19,75,79,"καὶ γὰρ ἐγώ ποτε οἶκον ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔναιον

ἦσαν δὲ δμῶες μάλα μυρίοι, ἄλλα τε πολλὰ
οἷσίν τ᾽ εὖ ζώουσι καὶ ἀφνειοὶ καλέονται.","For I too once dwelt in a house of my own among men, a rich man in a wealthy house, and full often I gave gifts to a wanderer, whosoever he was and with whatsoever need he came. Slaves too I had past counting and all other things in abundance whereby men live well and are reputed wealthy."
19,80,84,"ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ἀλάπαξε Κρονίων: ἤθελε γάρ που:

ἢ Ὀδυσεὺς ἔλθῃ: ἔτι γὰρ καὶ ἐλπίδος αἶσα.","But Zeus, son of Cronos, brought all to naught; so, I ween, was his good pleasure. Wherefore, woman, beware lest thou too some day lose all the glory whereby thou now hast excellence among the handmaids; lest perchance thy mistress wax wroth and be angry with thee, or Odysseus come home; for there is yet room for hope."
19,85,88,"εἰ δ᾽ ὁ μὲν ὣς ἀπόλωλε καὶ οὐκέτι νόστιμός ἐστιν,

19,89,89,"ὣς φάτο, τοῦ δ᾽ ἤκουσε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια,","
So he spoke, and wise Penelope heard him;"
19,90,94,"ἀμφίπολον δ᾽ ἐνένιπεν ἔπος τ᾽ ἔφατ᾽ ἔκ τ᾽ ὀνόμαζε:

“Be sure, thou bold and shameless thing, that thy outrageous deed is in no wise hid from me, and with thine own head shalt thou wipe out its stain. Full well didst thou know, for thou hast heard it from my own lips, that I was minded"
19,95,99,"ἀμφὶ πόσει εἴρεσθαι,  ἐπεὶ πυκινῶς ἀκάχημαι.

With this she spoke also to the housewife Eurynome, and said: “Eurynome, bring hither a chair and a fleece upon it, that the stranger may sit down and tell his tale, and listen to me; for I am fain to ask him of all things.” 
"
19,100,104,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽,  ἡ δὲ μάλ᾽ ὀτραλέως κατέθηκε φέρουσα

“Stranger, this question will I myself ask thee first."
19,105,109,"τίς πόθεν εἶς ἀνδρῶν;  πόθι τοι πόλις ἠδὲ τοκῆες;

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Lady, no one of mortals upon the boundless earth could find fault with thee, for thy fame goes up to the broad heaven, as does the fame of some blameless king, who with the fear of the gods in his heart,"
19,110,114,"ἀνδράσιν ἐν πολλοῖσι καὶ ἰφθίμοισιν ἀνάσσων

I know not whether Odysseus was thus clothed at home, or whether one of his comrades gave him the raiment when he went on board the swift ship, or haply even some stranger, since to many men"
19,240,240,ἔσκε φίλος: παῦροι γὰρ Ἀχαιῶν ἦσαν ὁμοῖοι.,"was Odysseus dear, for few of the Achaeans were his peers."
19,241,244,"καί οἱ ἐγὼ χάλκειον ἄορ καὶ δίπλακα δῶκα

καὶ μέν οἱ κῆρυξ ὀλίγον προγενέστερος αὐτοῦ","
 I, too, gave him a sword of bronze, and a fair purple cloak of double fold, and a fringed tunic, and with all honor sent him forth on his benched ship. Furthermore, a herald"
19,245,249,"εἵπετο: καὶ τόν τοι μυθήσομαι,  οἷος ἔην περ.

He was round-shouldered, dark of skin, and curly-haired, and his name was Eurybates; and Odysseus honored him above his other comrades, because he was like-minded with himself.”
So he spoke, and in her heart aroused yet more the desire of weeping,"
19,250,254,"σήματ᾽ ἀναγνούσῃ τά οἱ ἔμπεδα πέφραδ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς.

ἐν μεγάροισιν ἐμοῖσι φίλος τ᾽ ἔσῃ αἰδοῖός τε:","as she recognized the sure tokens that Odysseus told her. But she, when she had had her fill of tearful wailing, made answer and said to him:
“Now verily, stranger, though before thou wast pitied, shalt thou be dear and honored in my halls,"
19,255,259,"αὐτὴ γὰρ τάδε εἵματ᾽ ἐγὼ πόρον,  οἷ᾽ ἀγορεύεις,

But my husband I shall never welcome back, returning home to his dear native land. Wherefore it was with an evil fate that Odysseus"
19,260,264,"ᾤχετ᾽ ἐποψόμενος Κακοΐλιον οὐκ ὀνομαστήν.

τῆκε, πόσιν γοόωσα. νεμεσσῶμαί γε μὲν οὐδέν:","went forth in the hollow ship to see evil Ilios, that should never be named.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, mar not now thy fair face any more, nor waste thy heart at all in weeping for thy husband. I count it indeed no blame in thee;"
19,265,269,"καὶ γάρ τίς τ᾽ ἀλλοῖον ὀδύρεται ἄνδρ᾽ ὀλέσασα

Yet do thou cease from weeping, and hearken to my words; for I will tell thee with sure truth, and will hide nothing,"
19,270,274,"ὡς ἤδη Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ περὶ νόστου ἄκουσα

But he lost his trusty comrades and his hollow ship on the wine-dark sea,"
19,275,276,"Θρινακίης ἄπο νήσου ἰών: ὀδύσαντο γὰρ αὐτῷ
Ζεύς τε καὶ Ἠέλιος: τοῦ γὰρ βόας ἔκταν ἑταῖροι.",as he journeyed from the isle Thrinacia; for Zeus and Helios waxed wroth against him because his comrades had slain the kine of Helios.
19,277,279,"οἱ μὲν πάντες ὄλοντο πολυκλύστῳ ἐνὶ πόντῳ:

So they all perished in the surging sea, but he on the keel of his ship was cast forth by the wave on the shore, on the land of the Phaeacians, who are near of kin to the gods."
19,280,284,"οἳ δή μιν περὶ κῆρι θεὸν ὣς τιμήσαντο

Yea, and Odysseus would long since have been here, only it seemed to his mind more profitable to gather wealth by roaming over the wide earth;"
19,285,289,"ὣς περὶ κέρδεα πολλὰ καταθνητῶν ἀνθρώπων

Thus Pheidon, king of the Thesprotians, told me the tale. Moreover he swore in my own presence, as he poured libations in his halls, that the ship was launched and the men ready"
19,290,294,"οἳ δή μιν πέμψουσι φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν.

But me he sent forth first, for a ship of the Thesprotians chanced to be setting out for Dulichium, rich in wheat. And he showed me all the treasure that Odysseus had gathered; verily unto the tenth generation would it feed his children after him,"
19,295,299,"ὅσσα οἱ ἐν μεγάροις κειμήλια κεῖτο ἄνακτος.

But Odysseus, he said, had gone to Dodona to hear the will of Zeus from the high-crested oak of the god, even how he might return to his dear native land after so long an absence, whether openly or in secret.
"
19,300,304,"ὣς ὁ μὲν οὕτως ἐστὶ σόος καὶ ἐλεύσεται ἤδη

Yet will I give thee an oath. Be Zeus my witness first, highest and best of gods, and the hearth of noble Odysseus to which I am come,"
19,305,309,"ἦ μέν τοι τάδε πάντα τελείεται ὡς ἀγορεύω.

Then wise Penelope answered him: “Ah, stranger, I would that this word of thine might be fulfilled."
19,310,314,"τῷ κε τάχα γνοίης φιλότητά τε πολλά τε δῶρα

Yet in my heart I forebode it thus, even as it shall be. Neither shall Odysseus any more come home, nor shalt thou obtain a convoy hence, since there are not now in the house such masters"

But still, my maidens, wash the stranger's feet and prepare his bed—bedstead and cloaks and bright coverlets—that in warmth and comfort he may come to the golden-throned Dawn."

Then wise Penelope answered him again:"

19,360,360,αἶψα γὰρ ἐν κακότητι βροτοὶ καταγηράσκουσιν.,for quickly do men grow old in evil fortune.”

So she spoke, and the old woman hid her face in her hands and let fall hot tears, uttering words of lamentation:
“Ah, woe is me, child, because of thee, for that I can do naught. Surely Zeus hated thee above all men, though thou hadst a god-fearing heart."
19,365,369,"οὐ γάρ πώ τις τόσσα βροτῶν Διὶ τερπικεραύνῳ

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Old dame, so say all men whose eyes have beheld us two, that"

So he spoke, and the old dame took the shining cauldron with water wherefrom she was about to wash his feet, and poured in cold water in plenty, and then added thereto the warm. But Odysseus sat him down away from the hearth and straightway turned himself toward the darkness,"

Lo, inasmuch as I am come hither as one that has been angered with many, both men and women, over the fruitful earth, therefore let the name by which the child is named be Odysseus. And for my part,"

Then wise Eurycleia answered him: “My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth! Thou knowest how firm my spirit is and unyielding: I shall be as close as hard stone or iron."

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said:"

So he spoke, and the old woman went forth through the hall to bring water for his feet, for all the first was spilled."

Then wise Penelope was the first to speak, saying: “Stranger, this little thing further will I ask thee myself,"

But to me has a god given sorrow that is beyond all measure, for day by day I find my joy in mourning and lamenting, while looking to my household tasks and those of my women in the house,"

19,544,544,"ἂψ δ᾽ ἐλθὼν κατ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἕζετ᾽ ἐπὶ προὔχοντι μελάθρῳ,","
Then back he came and perched upon a projecting roof-beam,"
19,545,549,"φωνῇ δὲ βροτέῃ κατερήτυε φώνησέν τε:

“‘Be of good cheer, daughter of far-famed Icarius; this is no dream, but a true vision of good which shall verily find fulfillment. The geese are the wooers, and I, that before was the eagle, am now again come back as thy husband,"

“So he spoke, and sweet sleep released me, and looking about I saw the geese in the halls, feeding on wheat beside the trough, where they had before been wont to feed.”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her and said:"
19,555,559,"ὦ γύναι,  οὔ πως ἔστιν ὑποκρίνασθαι ὄνειρον

For the wooers' destruction is plain to see, for one and all; not one of them shall escape death and the fates.”
Then wise Penelope answered him again:"

For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ivory"

But those that come forth through the gate of polished horn bring true issues to pass, when any mortal sees them. But in my case it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came. Ah, truly it would then have been welcome to me and to my son."

Even now is coming on this morn of evil name which is to cut me off from the house of Odysseus; for now I shall appoint for a contest those axes which he was wont to set up in line in his halls, like props of a ship that is building, twelve in all,"
19,575,575,στὰς δ᾽ ὅ γε πολλὸν ἄνευθε διαρρίπτασκεν ὀϊστόν.,and he would stand afar off and shoot an arrow through them.

Now then I shall set this contest before the wooers: whosoever shall most easily string the bow in his hands, and shoot an arrow through all twelve axes, with him will I go and forsake this house"

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Honored wife of Odysseus, son of Laertes, no longer now do thou put off this contest in thy halls;"
19,585,589,"πρὶν γάρ τοι πολύμητις ἐλεύσεται ἐνθάδ᾽ Ὀδυσσεύς,

Then wise Penelope answered him: “If thou couldest but wish, stranger, to sit here in my halls"
19,590,594,"τέρπειν, οὔ κέ μοι ὕπνος ἐπὶ βλεφάροισι χυθείη.

But it is in no wise possible that men should forever be sleepless, for the immortals have appointed a proper time for each thing upon the earth, the giver of grain.

Εὐρυνόμη δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐπὶ χλαῖναν βάλε κοιμηθέντι.","But the goodly Odysseus lay down to sleep in the fore-hall of the house. On the ground he spread an undressed ox-hide and above it many fleeces of sheep, which the Achaeans were wont to slay, and Eurynome threw over him a cloak, when he had laid him down."
20,5,9,"ἔνθ᾽ Ὀδυσεὺς μνηστῆρσι κακὰ φρονέων ἐνὶ θυμῷ

τοῦ δ᾽ ὠρίνετο θυμὸς ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλοισι:","There Odysseus, pondering in his heart evil for the wooers, lay sleepless. And the women came forth from the hall, those that had before been wont to lie with the wooers, making laughter and merriment among themselves. But the heart was stirred in his breast,"
20,10,14,"πολλὰ δὲ μερμήριζε κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμόν,

20,15,19,"ἄνδρ᾽ ἀγνοιήσασ᾽ ὑλάει μέμονέν τε μάχεσθαι,

“Endure, my heart; a worse thing even than this didst thou once endure on that day when the Cyclops, unrestrained in daring, devoured my"
20,20,24,"ἰφθίμους ἑτάρους: σὺ δ᾽ ἐτόλμας,  ὄφρα σε μῆτις

So he spoke, chiding the heart in his breast, and his heart remained bound within him to endure steadfastly; but he himself lay tossing this way and that."
20,25,29,"ὡς δ᾽ ὅτε γαστέρ᾽ ἀνὴρ πολέος πυρὸς αἰθομένοιο,

20,30,34,"μοῦνος ἐὼν πολέσι.  σχεδόθεν δέ οἱ ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη

“Why now again art thou wakeful, ill-fated above all men? Lo, this is thy house, and here within is thy wife"
20,35,39,"καὶ, πάϊς,  οἷόν πού τις ἐέλδεται ἔμμεναι υἷα.

And Odysseus of many wiles answered her, and said: “Yea, goddess, all this hast thou spoken aright. But the heart in my breast is pondering somewhat upon this, how I may put forth my hands upon the shameless wooers,"
20,40,43,"μοῦνος ἐών: οἱ δ᾽ αἰὲν ἀολλέες ἔνδον ἔασι.

And furthermore this other and harder thing I ponder in my mind: even if I were to slay them by the will of Zeus and of thyself, where then should I find escape from bane? Of this I bid thee take thought.”"
20,44,44,τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:,"
Then the goddess, flashing-eyed Athena, answered him:"
20,45,49,"σχέτλιε,  καὶ μέν τίς τε χερείονι πείθεθ᾽ ἑταίρῳ,

There is weariness also in keeping wakeful watch the whole night through; and even now shalt thou come forth from out thy perils.”
So she spoke, and shed sleep upon his eyelids,"

Now while sleep seized him, loosening the cares of his heart, sleep that loosens the limbs of men, his true-hearted wife awoke, and wept, as she sat upon her soft bed. But when her heart had had its fill of weeping,"
20,60,64,"Ἀρτέμιδι πρώτιστον ἐπεύξατο δῖα γυναικῶν:

“Artemis, mighty goddess, daughter of Zeus, would that now thou wouldest fix thy arrow in my breast and take away my life even in this hour; or that a storm-wind might catch me up and bear me hence over the murky ways,"

20,90,90,"χαῖρ᾽,  ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἐφάμην ὄναρ ἔμμεναι, ἀλλ᾽ ὕπαρ ἤδη.","was glad, for I deemed it was no dream, but the truth at last.”"

So she spoke, and straightway came golden-throned Dawn. But as she wept goodly Odysseus heard her voice, and thereupon he mused, and it seemed to his heart that she knew him and was standing by his head."

“Father Zeus, if of your good will ye gods have brought me over land and sea to my own country, when ye had afflicted me sore,"
20,100,104,"φήμην τίς μοι φάσθω ἐγειρομένων ἀνθρώπων

So he spoke in prayer, and Zeus the counsellor heard him. Straightway he thundered from gleaming Olympus, from on high from out the clouds; and goodly Odysseus was glad."
20,105,109,"φήμην δ᾽ ἐξ οἴκοιο γυνὴ προέηκεν ἀλετρὶς

At these mills twelve women in all were wont to ply their tasks, making meal of barley and of wheat, the marrow of men. Now the others were sleeping, for they had ground their wheat,"
20,110,114,"ἡ δὲ μί᾽ οὔπω παύετ᾽,  ἀφαυροτάτη δ᾽ ἐτέτυκτο:

“Father Zeus, who art lord over gods and men, verily loud hast thou thundered from the starry sky, yet nowhere is there any cloud: surely this is a sign that thou art showing to some man."
20,115,119,"κρῆνον νῦν καὶ ἐμοὶ δειλῇ ἔπος,  ὅττι κεν εἴπω:

Now the other maidens in the fair palace of Odysseus had gathered together and were kindling on the hearth unwearied fire, and Telemachus rose from his bed, a godlike man,"

He sat here and drank wine as long as he would, but for food he said he had no more hunger, for she asked him. But when he bethought him of rest and sleep, she bade the maidens strew his bed."
20,140,144,"αὐτὰρ ὅ γ᾽,  ὥς τις πάμπαν ὀϊζυρὸς καὶ ἄποτμος,

So she spoke, and Telemachus went forth through the hall"

And he went his way to the place of assembly to join the company of the well-greaved Achaeans, but Eurycleia, the goodly lady, daughter of Ops, son of Peisenor, called to her maidens, saying:
“Come, let some of you busily sweep the hall"

So she spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Twenty of them went to the spring of dark water, and the others busied themselves there in the house in skilful fashion.

“Stranger, do the Achaeans look on thee with any more regard, or do they dishonor thee in the halls as before?”
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Ah, Eumaeus, I would that the gods might take vengeance on the outrage"

These had been brought over from the mainland by ferrymen, who send other men, too, on their way, whosoever comes to them. The beasts he tethered carefully beneath the echoing portico,"
20,190,194,"αὐτὸς δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἐρέεινε συβώτην ἄγχι παραστάς:

“Who is this stranger, swineherd, who has newly come to our house? From what men does he declare himself to be sprung? Where are his kinsmen and his native fields? Hapless man! Yet truly in form he is like a royal prince;"
20,195,199,"ἀλλὰ θεοὶ δυόωσι πολυπλάγκτους ἀνθρώπους,

Therewith he drew near to Odysseus, and stretching forth his right hand in greeting, spoke and addressed him with winged words:
“Hail, Sir stranger;"

Father Zeus, no other god is more baneful than thou; thou hast no pity on men when thou hast thyself given them birth, but bringest them into misery and wretched pains.

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Neatherd, since thou seemest to be neither an evil man nor a witless, and I see for myself that thou hast gotten an understanding heart, therefore will I speak out and swear a great oath to confirm my words."

And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus might come back to his own home.

So spoke Amphinomus, and his word was pleasing to them. Then, going into the house of godlike Odysseus, they laid their cloaks on the chairs and high seats,"

Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Nay, by Zeus, Agelaus, and by the woes of my father,"

And now they laughed with alien lips, and all bedabbled with blood was the flesh they ate, and their eyes were filled with tears and their spirits set on wailing."

So he spoke, but they all laughed merrily at him. And among them Eurymachus, son of Polybus, was the first to speak:

Then godlike Theoclymenus answered him: “Eurymachus, in no wise do I bid thee give me guides for my way."

So saying, he went forth from the stately halls and came to Piraeus, who received him with a ready heart. But all the wooers, looking at one another, sought to provoke Telemachus by laughing at his guests."
20,375,379,"ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:
Τηλέμαχ᾽, οὔ τις σεῖο κακοξεινώτερος ἄλλος:
οἷον μέν τινα τοῦτον ἔχεις ἐπίμαστον ἀλήτην,
σίτου καὶ οἴνου κεχρημένον, οὐδέ τι ἔργων
ἔμπαιον οὐδὲ βίης, ἀλλ᾽ αὔτως ἄχθος ἀρούρης.","And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Telemachus, no man is more unlucky in his guests than thou, seeing that thou keepest such a filthy vagabond as this man here, always wanting bread and wine, and skilled neither in the works of peace nor those of war, but a mere burden of the earth."
20,380,384,"ἄλλος δ᾽ αὖτέ τις οὗτος ἀνέστη μαντεύεσθαι.
ἀλλ᾽ εἴ μοί τι πίθοιο, τό κεν πολὺ κέρδιον εἴη:

ἐς Σικελοὺς πέμψωμεν, ὅθεν κέ τοι ἄξιον ἄλφοι.
ὣς ἔφασαν μνηστῆρες: ὁ δ᾽ οὐκ ἐμπάζετο μύθων,","And this other fellow again stood up to prophesy. Nay, if thou wouldst hearken to me it would be better far: let us fling these strangers on board a benched ship, and send them to the Sicilians, whence they would bring thee in a fitting price.”
So spake the wooers, but he paid no heed to their words."
20,385,389,"ἀλλ᾽ ἀκέων πατέρα προσεδέρκετο,  δέγμενος αἰεί,

But the daughter of Icarius, wise Penelope, had set her beautiful chair over against them, and heard the words of each man in the hall."
20,390,394,"δεῖπνον μὲν γάρ τοί γε γελοίωντες τετύκοντο

But never could meal have been more graceless than a supper such as a goddess and a mighty man were soon to set before them. For unprovoked they were contriving deeds of shame."
21,1,4,"τῇ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐπὶ φρεσὶ θῆκε θεὰ γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,

Odysseus verily had come to collect a debt which the whole people owed him, for the men of Messene had lifted from Ithaca in their benched ships three hundred sheep and the shepherds with them."

And now at the last he would haply have strung it in his might, as for the fourth time he sought to draw up the string, but Odysseus nodded in dissent, and checked him in his eagerness."

But Antinous rebuked him, and spoke, and addressed him: “Leiodes, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, a dread word and grievous! I am angered to hear it,"
21,170,174,"εἰ δὴ τοῦτό γε τόξον ἀριστῆας κεκαδήσει

For, I tell thee, thy honored mother did not bear thee of such strength as to draw a bow and shoot arrows; but others of the lordly wooers will soon string it.”

So he spoke, and Melanthius straightway rekindled the unwearied fire, and brought and placed by it a great seat with a fleece upon it, and he brought forth a great cake of the fat that was within. Therewith the youths warmed the bow, and made trial of it, but they could not"

Now Antinous was still persisting and godlike Eurymachus, leaders of the wooers, who were far the best in valiance; but those other two had gone forth both together from the hall, the neatherd and the swineherd of divine Odysseus;"
21,190,194,"ἐκ δ᾽ αὐτὸς μετὰ τοὺς δόμου ἤλυθε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.

“Neatherd, and thou too swineherd, shall I tell you something or keep it to myself? Nay, my spirit bids me tell it."

Then the herdsmen of the cattle answered him:"

And even in like manner did Eumaeus pray to all the gods that wise Odysseus; might come back to his own home."

So saying, he drew aside the rags from the great scar. And when the two had seen it, and had marked each thing well, they flung their arms about wise Odysseus, and wept; and they kissed his head and shoulders in loving welcome."

“Cease now from weeping and wailing, lest some one come forth from the hall and see us, and make it known within as well."

So saying, he entered the stately house, and went and sat down on the seat from which he had risen. And the two slaves of divine Odysseus went in as well.

“Out on it! Verily I am grieved for myself and for you all."

But when they had poured libations, and had drunk to their heart's content, then with crafty mind Odysseus of many wiles spoke among them:

πᾶσι, μάλιστα δ᾽ ἐμοί: τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστ᾽ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.","But do thou go thy chamber, and busy thyself with thine own tasks, the loom and the distaff, and bid thy handmaids ply their tasks. The bow shall be for men, for all, but most of all for me; since mine is the authority in the house.”"
21,354,354,ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει:,"
She then, seized with wonder, went back to her chamber,"
21,355,359,"παιδὸς γὰρ μῦθον πεπνυμένον ἔνθετο θυμῷ.
ἐς δ᾽ ὑπερῷ᾽ ἀναβᾶσα σὺν ἀμφιπόλοισι γυναιξὶ

αὐτὰρ ὁ τόξα λαβὼν φέρε καμπύλα δῖος ὑφορβός:","for she laid to heart the wise saying of her son. Up to her upper chamber she went with her handmaids, and then bewailed Odysseus, her dear husband, until flashing-eyed Athena cast sweet sleep upon her eyelids.
Now the goodly swineherd had taken the curved bow and was bearing it,"
21,360,364,"μνηστῆρες δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν:
ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:
πῆ δὴ καμπύλα τόξα φέρεις, ἀμέγαρτε συβῶτα,
πλαγκτέ; τάχ᾽ αὖ σ᾽ ἐφ᾽ ὕεσσι κύνες ταχέες κατέδονται
οἶον ἀπ᾽ ἀνθρώπων, οὓς ἔτρεφες, εἴ κεν Ἀπόλλων","but the wooers all cried out in the halls. And thus would one of the proud youths speak:
“Whither, pray, art thou bearing the curved bow, miserable swineherd, thou man distraught? Soon by thy swine, alone and apart from men, shall the swift hounds devour thee—hounds thyself didst rear—if but Apollo"
21,365,369,"ἡμῖν ἱλήκῃσι καὶ ἀθάνατοι θεοὶ ἄλλοι.
ὣς φάσαν, αὐτὰρ, ὁ θῆκε φέρων αὐτῇ ἐνὶ χώρῃ,
δείσας, οὕνεκα πολλοὶ ὁμόκλεον ἐν μεγάροισιν.
Τηλέμαχος δ᾽ ἑτέρωθεν ἀπειλήσας ἐγεγώνει:
ἄττα, πρόσω φέρε τόξα: τάχ᾽ οὐκ εὖ πᾶσι πιθήσεις","be gracious to us, and the other immortal gods.”
So they spoke, and he set down the bow, as he bore it, in that very place, seized with fear because many men were crying out aloud in the halls. But Telemachus on the other side called out threateningly:
“Father, bear the bow onward—soon shalt thou rue giving heed to all—"
21,370,374,"μή σε καὶ ὁπλότερός περ ἐὼν ἀγρόνδε δίωμαι,
βάλλων χερμαδίοισι: βίηφι δὲ φέρτερός εἰμι.
αἲ γὰρ πάντων τόσσον, ὅσοι κατὰ δώματ᾽ ἔασι,
μνηστήρων χερσίν τε βίηφί τε φέρτερος εἴην:
τῷ κε τάχα στυγερῶς τιν᾽ ἐγὼ πέμψαιμι νέεσθαι","lest, younger though I am, I drive thee to the field, and pelt thee with stones; for in strength I am the better. I would that I were even so much better in strength and might than all the wooers that are in the house; then would I soon send many a one"
21,375,379,"ἡμετέρου ἐξ οἴκου,  ἐπεὶ κακὰ μηχανόωνται.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ ἡδὺ γέλασσαν

Τηλεμάχῳ: τὰ δὲ τόξα φέρων ἀνὰ δῶμα συβώτης
ἐν χείρεσσ᾽ Ὀδυσῆϊ δαΐφρονι θῆκε παραστάς.","forth from our house to go his way in evil case; for they devise wickedness.”
So he spoke, but all the wooers laughed merrily at him, and relaxed the bitterness of their anger against Telemachus. Howbeit the swineherd bore the bow through the hall, and came up to wise Odysseus, and put it in his hands."
21,380,384,"ἐκ δὲ καλεσσάμενος προσέφη τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν:
Τηλέμαχος κέλεταί σε, περίφρων Εὐρύκλεια,

ἢν δέ τις ἤ στοναχῆς ἠὲ κτύπου ἔνδον ἀκούσῃ
ἀνδρῶν ἡμετέροισιν ἐν ἕρκεσι, μή τι θύραζε","Then he called forth the nurse Eurycleia, and said to her:
“Telemachus bids thee, wise Eurycleia, to bar the close-fitting doors of the hall, and if any of the women hear within groanings or the din of men within our walls, let them not"
21,385,389,"προβλώσκειν,  ἀλλ᾽ αὐτοῦ ἀκὴν ἔμεναι παρὰ ἔργῳ.

So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; and she barred the doors of the stately halls. 
But in silence Philoetius hastened forth from the house, and barred the gates of the well-fenced court."
21,390,394,"κεῖτο δ᾽ ὑπ᾽ αἰθούσῃ ὅπλον νεὸς ἀμφιελίσσης

Thereafter he came and sat down on the seat from which he had risen, and gazed upon Odysseus; now he was already handling the bow, turning it round and round, and trying it this way and that,"
21,395,399,"μὴ κέρα ἶπες ἔδοιεν ἀποιχομένοιο ἄνακτος.

“Verily he has a shrewd eye, and is a cunning knave with a bow. It may be haply that he has himself such bows stored away at home, or else he is minded to make one, that he thus"
21,400,400,νωμᾷ ἔνθα καὶ ἔνθα κακῶν ἔμπαιος ἀλήτης.,"turns it this way and that in his hands, the rascally vagabond.”"
21,401,404,"ἄλλος δ᾽ αὖ εἴπεσκε νέων ὑπερηνορεόντων:

ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἔφαν μνηστῆρες: ἀτὰρ πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς,","
And again another of the proud youths would say: “Would that the fellow might find profit in just such measure as he shall prove able ever to string this bow.”
So spoke the wooers, but Odysseus of many wiles,"
21,405,409,"αὐτίκ᾽ ἐπεὶ μέγα τόξον ἐβάστασε καὶ ἴδε πάντη,
ὡς ὅτ᾽ ἀνὴρ φόρμιγγος ἐπιστάμενος καὶ ἀοιδῆς

ἅψας ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἐϋστρεφὲς ἔντερον οἰός,
ὣς ἄρ᾽ ἄτερ σπουδῆς τάνυσεν μέγα τόξον Ὀδυσσεύς.","as soon as he had lifted the great bow and scanned it on every side—even as when a man well-skilled in the lyre and in song easily stretches the string about a new peg, making fast at either end the twisted sheep-gut—so without effort did Odysseus string the great bow."
21,410,414,"δεξιτερῇ ἄρα χειρὶ λαβὼν πειρήσατο νευρῆς:

ἐτράπετο: Ζεὺς δὲ μεγάλ᾽ ἔκτυπε σήματα φαίνων:
γήθησέν τ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔπειτα πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.","And he held it in his right hand, and tried the string, which sang sweetly beneath his touch, like to a swallow in tone. But upon the wooers came great grief, and the faces of them changed color, and Zeus thundered loud, shewing forth his signs. Then glad at heart was the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus"
21,415,419,"ὅττι ῥά οἱ τέρας ἧκε Κρόνου πάϊς ἀγκυλομήτεω:

This he took, and laid upon the bridge of the bow, and drew the bow-string and the notched arrow"
21,420,424,"αὐτόθεν ἐκ δίφροιο καθήμενος,  ἧκε δ᾽ ὀϊστὸν

“Telemachus, the stranger"
21,425,429,"ἥμενος,  οὐδέ τι τοῦ σκοποῦ ἤμβροτον οὐδέ τι τόξον

But now it is time that supper too be made ready for the Achaeans, while yet there is light, and thereafter must yet other sport be made"
21,430,434,"μολπῇ καὶ φόρμιγγι: τὰ γάρ τ᾽ ἀναθήματα δαιτός.

He spoke, and made a sign with his brows, and Telemachus, the dear son of divine Odysseus, girt about him his sharp sword, and took his spear in his grasp, and stood by the chair at his father's side, armed with gleaming bronze."
22,1,4,"αὐτὰρ ὁ γυμνώθη ῥακέων πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς,

"
22,5,9,"οὗτος μὲν δὴ ἄεθλος ἀάατος ἐκτετέλεσται:

ἦ τοι ὁ καλὸν ἄλεισον ἀναιρήσεσθαι ἔμελλε,","“Lo, now at last is this decisive contest ended; and now as for another mark, which till now no man has ever smitten, I will know if haply I may strike it, and Apollo grant me glory.”
He spoke, and aimed a bitter arrow at Antinous. Now he was on the point of raising to his lips a fair goblet,"
22,10,14,"χρύσεον ἄμφωτον,  καὶ δὴ μετὰ χερσὶν ἐνώμα,

For who among men that sat at meat could think that one man among many, how strong soever he were, would bring upon himself evil death and black fate?"
22,15,19,"τὸν δ᾽ Ὀδυσεὺς κατὰ λαιμὸν ἐπισχόμενος βάλεν ἰῷ,

22,20,24,"ὦσε ποδὶ πλήξας,  ἀπὸ δ᾽ εἴδατα χεῦεν ἔραζε:

Then into uproar broke the wooers through the halls, as they saw the man fallen, and from their high seats they sprang, driven in fear through the hall, gazing everywhere along the well-built walls;"
22,25,29,"οὐδέ πη ἀσπὶς ἔην οὐδ᾽ ἄλκιμον ἔγχος ἑλέσθαι.

καὶ γὰρ δὴ νῦν φῶτα κατέκτανες ὃς μέγ᾽ ἄριστος","but nowhere was there a shield or mighty spear to seize. But they railed at Odysseus with angry words:
“Stranger, to thy cost dost thou shoot at men; never again shalt thou take part in other contests; now is thy utter destruction sure. Aye, for thou hast now slain a man who was far the best"
22,30,34,"κούρων εἰν Ἰθάκῃ: τῷ σ᾽ ἐνθάδε γῦπες ἔδονται.

τοὺς δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:","of the youths in Ithaca; therefore shall vultures devour thee here.”
So spoke each man, for verily they thought that he had not slain the man willfully; and in their folly they knew not this, that over themselves one and all the cords of destruction had been made fast. Then with an angry glance from beneath his brows Odysseus of many wiles answered them:
"
22,35,39,"ὦ κύνες,  οὔ μ᾽ ἔτ᾽ ἐφάσκεθ᾽ ὑπότροπον οἴκαδ᾽ ἱκέσθαι

οὔτε θεοὺς δείσαντες, οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν,","“Ye dogs, ye thought that I should never more come home from the land of the Trojans, seeing that ye wasted my house, and lay with the maidservants by force, and while yet I lived covertly wooed my wife, having no fear of the gods, who hold broad heaven,"
22,40,41,"οὔτε τιν᾽ ἀνθρώπων νέμεσιν κατόπισθεν ἔσεσθαι:
νῦν ὑμῖν καὶ πᾶσιν ὀλέθρου πείρατ᾽ ἐφῆπται.","nor of the indignation of men, that is to be hereafter. Now over you one and all have the cords of destruction been made fast.”"
22,42,44,"ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δ᾽ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος εἷλεν:

So he spoke, and thereat pale fear seized them all, and each man gazed about to see how he might escape utter destruction; Eurymachus alone answered him, and said:
"

But he now lies dead, who was to blame for all, even Antinous; for it was he who set on foot these deeds,"
22,50,54,"οὔ τι γάμου τόσσον κεχρημένος οὐδὲ χατίζων,

But now he lies slain, as was his due, but do thou spare the people"
22,55,59,"σῶν: ἀτὰρ ἄμμες ὄπισθεν ἀρεσσάμενοι κατὰ δῆμον,

"
22,60,64,"τὸν δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

22,65,69,"νῦν ὑμῖν παράκειται ἐναντίον ἠὲ μάχεσθαι

So he spoke, and their knees were loosened where they stood, and their hearts melted; and Eurymachus spoke among them again a second time:
"
22,70,74,"ὦ φίλοι, οὐ γὰρ σχήσει ἀνὴρ ὅδε χεῖρας ἀάπτους,

22,79,79,ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας εἰρύσσατο φάσγανον ὀξὺ,"
So saying, he drew his sharp sword"
22,80,84,"χάλκεον,  ἀμφοτέρωθεν ἀκαχμένον, ἆλτο δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ αὐτῷ

But Telemachus was too quick for him, and cast, and smote him from behind with his bronze-tipped spear between the shoulders, and drove it through his breast; and he fell with a thud, and struck the ground full with his forehead."
22,95,99,"Τηλέμαχος δ᾽ ἀπόρουσε,  λιπὼν δολιχόσκιον ἔγχος

So he started to run, and came quickly to his dear father,"

“Father, now will I bring thee a shield and two spears and a helmet all of bronze, well fitted to the temples, and when I come back I will arm myself, and will give armour likewise to the swineherd and yon neatherd; for it is better to be clothed in armour.”
"
22,105,109,"τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and went his way to the store-chamber where the glorious arms were stored."
22,110,114,"ἔνθεν τέσσαρα μὲν σάκε᾽ ἔξελε,  δούρατα δ᾽ ὀκτὼ

ὣς δ᾽ αὔτως τὼ δμῶε δυέσθην τεύχεα καλά,","Thence he took four shields and eight spears and four helmets of bronze, with thick plumes of horse-hair; and he bore them forth, and quickly came to his dear father. Then first of all he himself girded the bronze about his body, and even in like manner the two slaves put on them the beautiful armour,"
22,115,119,"ἔσταν δ᾽ ἀμφ᾽ Ὀδυσῆα δαΐφρονα ποικιλομήτην.

But he, so long as he had arrows to defend him, would ever aim, and smite the wooers one by one in his house, and they fell thick and fast. But when the arrows failed the prince, as he shot,"
22,120,124,"τόξον μὲν πρὸς σταθμὸν ἐϋσταθέος μεγάροιο

For himself, he put about his shoulders a four-fold shield, and set on his mighty head a well-wrought helmet with horse-hair plume, and terribly did the plume wave above him;"
22,125,125,εἵλετο δ᾽ ἄλκιμα δοῦρε δύω κεκορυθμένα χαλκῷ.,"and he took two mighty spears, tipped with bronze."
22,126,129,"ὀρσοθύρη δέ τις ἔσκεν ἐϋδμήτῳ ἐνὶ τοίχῳ,

Now there was in the well-built wall a certain postern door, and along the topmost level of the threshold of the well-built hall was a way into a passage, and well-fitting folding doors closed it. This postern Odysseus bade the goodly swineherd watch,"
22,130,134,"ἑσταότ᾽ ἄγχ᾽ αὐτῆς: μία δ᾽ οἴη γίγνετ᾽ ἐφορμή.

“Friends, will not one mount up by the postern door, and tell the people, that so an alarm may be raised straightway? Then should this fellow soon have shot his last.”
"
22,135,139,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε Μελάνθιος, αἰπόλος αἰγῶν:

One man could bar the way for all, so he were valiant. But come, let me bring you"
22,140,144,"ἐκ θαλάμου: ἔνδον γάρ,  ὀΐομαι, οὐδέ πη ἄλλῃ

So saying, Melanthius, the goatherd, mounted up by the steps of the hall to the store-rooms of Odysseus. Thence he took twelve shields, as many spears,"
22,145,149,"καὶ τόσσας κυνέας χαλκήρεας ἱπποδασείας:

Then the knees of Odysseus were loosened and his heart melted, when he saw them donning armour and brandishing long spears in their hands, and great did his task seem to him;"
22,150,154,"αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:

“Telemachus, verily some one of the women in the halls is rousing against us an evil battle, or haply it is Melanthius.”
Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Father, it is I myself that am at fault in this, and no other"

“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices,"
22,165,169,"κεῖνος δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἀΐδηλος ἀνήρ,  ὃν ὀϊόμεθ᾽ αὐτοί,

22,175,179,"σειρὴν δὲ πλεκτὴν ἐξ αὐτοῦ πειρήναντε

So he spoke, and they readily hearkened and obeyed. Forth they went to the store-room, unseen of him who was within."

There they stood, breathing fury, those on the threshold but four, while those within the hall were many and brave."
22,205,209,"τοῖσι δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἀγχίμολον θυγάτηρ Διὸς ἦλθεν Ἀθήνη,

“Mentor, ward off ruin, and remember me, thy dear comrade, who often befriended thee. Thou art of like age with myself.”"
22,210,214,"ὣς φάτ᾽,  ὀϊόμενος λαοσσόον ἔμμεν Ἀθήνην.

“Mentor, let not Odysseus beguile thee with his words to fight against the wooers and bear aid to himself."
22,215,219,"ὧδε γὰρ ἡμέτερόν γε νόον τελέεσθαι ὀΐω:

So he spoke, and Athena waxed the more wroth at heart,"
22,225,229,"νείκεσσεν δ᾽ Ὀδυσῆα χολωτοῖσιν ἐπέεσσιν:

“Odysseus, no longer hast thou steadfast might nor any valor, such as was thine when for high-born Helen of the white arms thou didst for nine years battle with the Trojans unceasingly, and many men thou slewest in dread conflict,"

μῦθον ἐπιτρέψαι, ἐπεὶ ἦ πολὺ φέρτεροί εἰσι.","and thereafter the herdsman of the cattle smote Ctesippus in the breast, and boasted over him, saying:
“Son of Polytherses, thou lover of revilings, never more at all do thou speak big, yielding to folly, but leave the matter to the gods, since verily they are mightier far."
22,290,291,"τοῦτό τοι ἀντὶ ποδὸς ξεινήϊον,  ὅν ποτ᾽ ἔδωκας
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆϊ δόμον κάτ᾽ ἀλητεύοντι.","This is thy gift of welcome to match the hoof which of late thou gavest to godlike Odysseus, when he went begging through the house.”"
22,292,294,"ἦ ῥα βοῶν ἑλίκων ἐπιβουκόλος: αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
οὖτα Δαμαστορίδην αὐτοσχεδὸν ἔγχεϊ μακρῷ.
Τηλέμαχος δ᾽ Εὐηνορίδην Λειώκριτον οὖτα","
So spoke the herdsman of the sleek cattle. But Odysseus wounded the son of Damastor in close fight with a thrust of his long spear, and Telemachus wounded Leiocritus, son of Evenor,"
22,295,299,"δουρὶ μέσον κενεῶνα,  διαπρὸ δὲ χαλκὸν ἔλασσεν:

Then Athena held up her aegis, the bane of mortals, on high from the roof, and the minds of the wooers were panic-stricken, and they fled through the halls like a herd of kine"
22,300,304,"τὰς μέν τ᾽ αἰόλος οἶστρος ἐφορμηθεὶς ἐδόνησεν

And even as vultures of crooked talons and curved beaks come forth from the mountains and dart upon smaller birds, which scour the plain, flying low beneath the clouds,"
22,305,309,"οἱ δέ τε τὰς ὀλέκουσιν ἐπάλμενοι,  οὐδέ τις ἀλκὴ

And therefrom rose hideous groaning as heads were smitten, and all the floor swam with blood.
"
22,310,314,"λειώδης δ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος ἐπεσσύμενος λάβε γούνων,

“By thy knees I beseech thee, Odysseus, and do thou respect me and have pity. For I declare to thee that never yet have I wronged one of the women in thy halls by wanton word or deed; nay,"
22,315,319,"παύεσκον μνηστῆρας,  ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι.

But they would not hearken to me to withhold their hands from evil, wherefore through their wanton folly they have met a cruel doom. Yet I, the soothsayer among them, that have done no wrong, shall be laid low even as they; so true is it that there is no gratitude in aftertime for good deeds done.”
"
22,320,324,"τὸν δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ὑπόδρα ἰδὼν προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

22,325,329,"τῷ οὐκ ἂν θάνατόν γε δυσηλεγέα προφύγοισθα.

So saying, he seized in his strong hand a sword that lay near, which Agelaus had let fall to the ground when he was slain, and with this he smote him full upon the neck. And even while he was yet speaking his head was mingled with the dust."
22,330,334,"Τερπιάδης δ᾽ ἔτ᾽ ἀοιδὸς ἀλύσκανε κῆρα μέλαιναν,

He stood with the clear-toned lyre in his hands near the postern door, and he was divided in mind whether he should slip out from the hall"
22,335,339,"ἑρκείου ἵζοιτο τετυγμένον,  ἔνθ᾽ ἄρα πολλὰ

And as he pondered this seemed to him the better course, to clasp the knees of Odysseus, son of Laertes."
22,340,344,"ἦ τοι ὁ φόρμιγγα γλαφυρὴν κατέθηκε χαμᾶζε

So he spoke, and the strong and mighty Telemachus heard him,"
22,355,359,"αἶψα δ᾽ ἑὸν πατέρα προσεφώνεεν ἐγγὺς ἐόντα:

“Stay thy hand, and do not wound this guiltless man with the sword. Aye, and let us save also the herald, Medon, who ever cared for me in our house, when I was a child—unless perchance Philoetius has already slain him, or the swineherd,"
22,360,364,"ἠὲ σοὶ ἀντεβόλησεν ὀρινομένῳ κατὰ δῶμα.

αἶψα δ᾽ ἀπὸ θρόνου ὦρτο, θοῶς δ᾽ ἀπέδυνε βοείην","or he met thee as thou didst rage through the house.”
So he spoke, and Medon, wise of heart, heard him, for he lay crouching beneath a chair, and had clothed himself in the skin of an ox, newly flayed, seeking to avoid black fate. Straightway he rose from beneath the chair and stripped off the ox-hide,"
22,365,369,"Τηλέμαχον δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔπειτα προσαΐξας λάβε γούνων,

“Friend, here I am; stay thou thy hand and bid thy father stay his, lest in the greatness of his might he harm me with the sharp bronze in his wrath against the wooers, who wasted his"
22,370,374,"κτήματ᾽ ἐνὶ μεγάροις,  σὲ δὲ νήπιοι οὐδὲν ἔτιον.

But Odysseus of many wiles smiled, and said to him: “Be of good cheer, for he has delivered thee and saved thee, that thou mayest know in thy heart and tell also to another, how far better is the doing of good deeds than of evil."
22,375,377,"ἀλλ᾽ ἐξελθόντες μεγάρων ἕζεσθε θύραζε

“Telemachus, go call me the nurse Eurycleia, that I may tell her the word that is in my mind.”
So he spoke, and Telemachus hearkened to his dear father, and shaking the door said to Eurycleia:

So he spoke, but her word remained unwinged; she opened the doors of the stately hall,"

“In thine own heart rejoice, old dame, but refrain thyself and cry not out aloud: an unholy thing is it to boast over slain men. These men here has the fate of the gods destroyed and their own reckless deeds, for they honored no one of men upon the earth,"

So he spoke, and the old dame went forth through the hall to bear tidings to the women, and bid them come;"

So he spoke, and the women came all in a throng, wailing terribly and shedding big tears. First they bore forth the bodies of the slain and set them down beneath the portico of the well-fenced court,"

“Let it be by no clean death that I take the lives of these women, who on my own head have poured reproaches and on my mother, and were wont to lie with the wooers.”"

22,470,474,"αὖλιν ἐσιέμεναι,  στυγερὸς δ᾽ ὑπεδέξατο κοῖτος,

Thereafter they washed their hands and feet, and went into the house to Odysseus, and the work was done."
22,480,484,"αὐτὰρ ὅ γε προσέειπε φίλην τροφὸν Εὐρύκλειαν:

πάσας δ᾽ ὄτρυνον δμῳὰς κατὰ δῶμα νέεσθαι.","But Odysseus said to the dear nurse Eurycleia: “Bring sulphur, old dame, to cleanse from pollution, and bring me fire, that I may purge the hall; and do thou bid Penelope come hither with her handmaidens, and order all the women in the house to come.”
"
22,485,489,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια:

μηδ᾽ οὕτω ῥάκεσιν πεπυκασμένος εὐρέας ὤμους

But come, let me bring thee a cloak and a tunic for raiment, and do not thou stand thus in the halls with thy broad shoulders wrapped in rags; that were a cause for blame.”
"
22,490,494,"τὴν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς:

ἤνεικεν δ᾽ ἄρα πῦρ καὶ θήϊον: αὐτὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς
εὖ διεθείωσεν μέγαρον καὶ δῶμα καὶ αὐλήν.","Then Odysseus of many wiles answered her: “First of all let a fire now be made me in the hall.”
So he spoke, and the dear nurse Eurycleia did not disobey, but brought fire and sulphur; but Odysseus throughly purged the hall and the house and the court.
"
22,495,499,"γρηῢς δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ ἀπέβη διὰ δώματα κάλ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος

They thronged about Odysseus and embraced him, and clasped and kissed his head and shoulders"

Her knees moved nimbly, but her feet trotted along beneath her; and she stood above her lady's head, and spoke to her, and said:

23,5,9,"ἔγρεο,  Πηνελόπεια, φίλον τέκος, ὄφρα ἴδηαι

Odysseus is here, and has come home, late though his coming has been, and has slain the proud wooers who vexed his house, and devoured his substance, and oppressed his son.”
"
23,10,14,"τὴν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:

οἵ σέ περ ἔβλαψαν: πρὶν δὲ φρένας αἰσίμη ἦσθα.","Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, the gods have made thee mad, they who can make foolish even one who is full wise, and set the simple-minded in the paths of understanding; it is they that have marred thy wits, though heretofore thou wast sound of mind."
23,15,19,"τίπτε με λωβεύεις πολυπενθέα θυμὸν ἔχουσαν

For never yet have I slept so sound since the day when Odysseus went forth to see evil Ilios that should not be named."
23,20,24,"ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε νῦν κατάβηθι καὶ ἂψ ἔρχευ μέγαρόνδε.

"
23,25,29,"τὴν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια:

Τηλέμαχος δ᾽ ἄρα μιν πάλαι ᾔδεεν ἔνδον ἐόντα,","Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her: “I mock thee not, dear child, but in very truth Odysseus is here, and has come home, even as I tell thee. He is that stranger to whom all men did dishonor in the halls. But Telemachus long ago knew that he was here,"
23,30,34,"ἀλλὰ σαοφροσύνῃσι νοήματα πατρὸς ἔκευθεν,

καί μιν φωνήσασ᾽ ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:","yet in his prudence he hid the purpose of his father, till he should take vengeance on the violence of overweening men.”
So she spoke, and Penelope was glad, and she leapt from her bed and flung her arms about the old woman and let the tears fall from her eyelids; and she spoke, and addressed her with winged words:
"
23,35,39,"εἰ δ᾽ ἄγε δή μοι,  μαῖα φίλη, νημερτὲς ἐνίσπες,

τὴν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια:","“Come now, dear nurse, I pray thee tell me truly, if verily he has come home, as thou sayest, how he put forth his hands upon the shameless wooers, all alone as he was, while they remained always in a body in the house.”
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:"
23,40,44,"οὐκ ἴδον,  οὐ πυθόμην, ἀλλὰ στόνον οἶον ἄκουσα

Τηλέμαχος: τὸν γάρ ῥα πατὴρ προέηκε καλέσσαι.","“I saw not, I asked not; only I heard the groaning of men that were being slain. As for us women, we sat terror-stricken in the innermost part of our well-built chambers, and the close-fitting doors shut us in, until the hour when thy son Telemachus called me from the hall, for his father had sent him forth to call me."
23,45,48,"εὗρον ἔπειτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆα μετὰ κταμένοισι νέκυσσιν

23,49,49,νῦν δ᾽ οἱ μὲν δὴ πάντες ἐπ᾽ αὐλείῃσι θύρῃσιν,"
And now the bodies are all gathered together at the gates of the court,"
23,50,54,"ἀθρόοι,  αὐτὰρ ὁ δῶμα θεειοῦται περικαλλές,

Nay, come with me, that the hearts of you two may enter into joy, for you have suffered many woes. But now at length has this thy long desire been fulfilled:"
23,55,59,"ἦλθε μὲν αὐτὸς ζωὸς ἐφέστιος,  εὗρε δὲ καὶ σὲ

Then wise Penelope answered her: “Dear nurse, boast not yet loudly over them with laughter."
23,60,64,"οἶσθα γὰρ ὥς κ᾽ ἀσπαστὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισι φανείη

But this is no true tale, as thou tellest it; nay, some one of the immortals has slain the lordly wooers in wrath at their grievous insolence and their evil deeds."
23,65,69,"οὔ τινα γὰρ τίεσκον ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων,

τὴν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα φίλη τροφὸς Εὐρύκλεια:","For they honored no one among men upon the earth, were he evil or good, whosoever came among them; therefore it is through their own wanton folly that they have suffered evil. But Odysseus far away has lost his return to the land of Achaea, and is lost himself.”
Then the dear nurse Eurycleia answered her:"
23,70,74,"τέκνον ἐμόν,  ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων,

οὐλήν, τήν ποτέ μιν σῦς ἤλασε λευκῷ ὀδόντι.","“My child, what a word has escaped the barrier of thy teeth, in that thou saidst that thy husband, who even now is here, at his own hearth, would never more return! Thy heart is ever unbelieving. Nay come, I will tell thee a manifest sign besides, even the scar of the wound which long ago the boar dealt him with his white tusk."
23,75,79,"τὴν ἀπονίζουσα φρασάμην,  ἔθελον δὲ σοὶ αὐτῇ

So come with me; but I will set my very life at stake that, if I deceive thee, thou shouldest slay me by a most pitiful death.”
"
23,80,84,"τὴν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:

23,85,89,"ὣς φαμένη κατέβαιν᾽ ὑπερώϊα: πολλὰ δέ οἱ κῆρ

But when she had come in and had passed over the stone threshold, she sat down opposite Odysseus in the light of the fire"

Howbeit she sat long in silence, and amazement came upon her soul; and now with her eyes she would look full upon his face, and now again"
23,95,99,"ἄλλοτε δ᾽ ἀγνώσασκε κακὰ χροῒ εἵματ᾽ ἔχοντα.

“My mother, cruel mother, that hast an unyielding heart, why dost thou thus hold aloof from my father, and dost not sit by his side and ask and question him?"
23,100,104,"οὐ μέν κ᾽ ἄλλη γ᾽ ὧδε γυνὴ τετληότι θυμῷ

τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:","No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband, who after many grievous toils had come back to her in the twentieth year to his native land: but thy heart is ever harder than stone.” 
Then wise Penelope answered him:"
23,105,109,"τέκνον ἐμόν,  θυμός μοι ἐνὶ στήθεσσι τέθηπεν,

23,110,114,"σήμαθ᾽,  ἃ δὴ καὶ νῶϊ κεκρυμμένα ἴδμεν ἀπ᾽ ἄλλων.

Τηλέμαχ᾽, ἦ τοι μητέρ᾽ ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἔασον

So she spoke, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus smiled, and straightway spoke to Telemachus winged words:
“Telemachus, suffer now thy mother to test me in the halls; presently shall she win more certain knowledge."
23,115,119,"νῦν δ᾽ ὅττι ῥυπόω,  κακὰ δὲ χροῒ εἵματα εἷμαι,

But for us, let us take thought how all may be the very best. For whoso has slain but one man in a land, even though it be a man that leaves not many behind to avenge him,"
23,120,124,"φεύγει πηούς τε προλιπὼν καὶ πατρίδα γαῖαν:

Then wise Telemachus answered him: “Do thou thyself look to this, dear father; for thy"

23,129,129,τὸν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη πολύμητις Ὀδυσσεύς,"
Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him and said:"
23,130,134,"τοιγὰρ ἐγὼν ἐρέω ὥς μοι δοκεῖ εἶναι ἄριστα.

First bathe yourselves, and put on your tunics, and bid the handmaids in the halls to take their raiment. But let the divine minstrel with his clear-toned lyre in hand be our leader in the gladsome dance,"
23,135,139,"ὥς κέν τις φαίη γάμον ἔμμεναι ἐκτὸς ἀκούων,

There"

So he spoke, and they all readily hearkened and obeyed. First they bathed and put on their tunics, and the women arrayed themselves, and the divine minstrel took the hollow lyre and aroused in them the desire"

“Aye, verily some one has wedded the queen wooed of many."

So they would say, but they knew not how these things were. Meanwhile the housewife Eurynome bathed the great-hearted Odysseus in his house, and anointed him with oil,"

23,165,169,"ἀντίον ἧς ἀλόχου,  καί μιν πρὸς μῦθον ἔειπε:

“Strange lady! to thee beyond all women have the dwellers on Olympus given a heart that cannot be softened. No other woman would harden her heart as thou dost, and stand aloof from her husband who after many grievous toils"

24,165,169,"σὺν μὲν Τηλεμάχῳ περικαλλέα τεύχε᾽ ἀείρας
ἐς θάλαμον κατέθηκε καὶ ἐκλήϊσεν ὀχῆας,
αὐτὰρ ὁ ἣν ἄλοχον πολυκερδείῃσιν ἄνωγε
τόξον μνηστήρεσσι θέμεν πολιόν τε σίδηρον,
ἡμῖν αἰνομόροισιν ἀέθλια καὶ φόνου ἀρχήν.",with the help of Telemachus he took all the beautiful arms and laid them away in the store-room and made fast the bolts. Then in his great cunning he bade his wife set before the wooers his bow and the grey iron to be a contest for us ill-fated men and the beginning of death.
24,170,174,"οὐδέ τις ἡμείων δύνατο κρατεροῖο βιοῖο
νευρὴν ἐντανύσαι, πολλὸν δ᾽ ἐπιδευέες ἦμεν.
ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε χεῖρας ἵκανεν Ὀδυσσῆος μέγα τόξον,
ἔνθ᾽ ἡμεῖς μὲν πάντες ὁμοκλέομεν ἐπέεσσι
τόξον μὴ δόμεναι, μηδ᾽ εἰ μάλα πολλ᾽ ἀγορεύοι:","And no man of us was able to stretch the string of the mighty bow; nay, we fell far short of that strength. But when the great bow came to the hands of Odysseus, then we all cried out aloud not to give him the bow, how much soever he might speak;"
24,175,179,"Τηλέμαχος δέ μιν οἶος ἐποτρύνων ἐκέλευσεν.
αὐτὰρ ὁ δέξατο χειρὶ πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
ῥηϊδίως δ᾽ ἐτάνυσσε βιόν, διὰ δ᾽ ἧκε σιδήρου,
στῆ δ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἐπ᾽ οὐδὸν ἰών, ταχέας δ᾽ ἐκχεύατ᾽ ὀϊστοὺς
δεινὸν παπταίνων, βάλε δ᾽ Ἀντίνοον βασιλῆα.","but Telemachus alone urged him on, and bade him take it. Then he took the bow in his hand, the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and with ease did he string it and send an arrow through the iron. Then he went and stood on the threshold, and poured out the swift arrows, glaring about him terribly, and smote king Antinous."
24,180,184,"αὐτὰρ ἔπειτ᾽ ἄλλοις ἐφίει βέλεα στονόεντα,
ἄντα τιτυσκόμενος: τοὶ δ᾽ ἀγχιστῖνοι ἔπιπτον.

αὐτίκα γὰρ κατὰ δώματ᾽ ἐπισπόμενοι μένεϊ σφῷ
κτεῖνον ἐπιστροφάδην, τῶν δὲ στόνος ὤρνυτ᾽ ἀεικὴς","And thereafter upon the others he with sure aim let fly his shafts, fraught with groanings, and the men fell thick and fast. Then was it known that some god was their helper; for straightway rushing on through the halls in their fury they slew men left and right, and therefrom rose hideous groaning,"
24,185,189,"κράτων τυπτομένων,  δάπεδον δ᾽ ἅπαν αἵματι θῦεν.

Thus we perished, Agamemnon, and even now our bodies still lie uncared-for in the halls of Odysseus; for our friends in each man's home know naught as yet—our friends who might wash the black blood from our wounds"
24,190,190,κατθέμενοι γοάοιεν: ὃ γὰρ γέρας ἐστὶ θανόντων.,and lay our bodies out with wailing; for that is the due of the dead.”
24,191,194,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε ψυχὴ προσεφώνεεν Ἀτρεΐδαο:

Then the spirit of the son of Atreus answered him: “Happy son of Laertes, Odysseus of many devices, of a truth full of all excellence was the wife thou didst win, so good of understanding was peerless Penelope,"
24,195,199,"κούρῃ Ἰκαρίου: ὡς εὖ μέμνητ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος,

Therefore the fame of her virtue shall never perish, but the immortals shall make among men on earth a pleasant song in honor of constant Penelope. Not on this wise did the daughter of Tyndareus devise evil deeds"

Thus the two spoke to one another, as they stood in the house of Hades beneath the depths of the earth.

There was his house, and all about it ran the sheds in which ate, and sat, and slept"

“Do you now go within the well-built house,"

So saying, he gave to the slaves his battle-gear."

But he found his father alone in the well-ordered vineyard, digging about a plant; and he was clothed in a foul tunic, patched and wretched, and about his shins he had bound stitched greaves of ox-hide to guard against scratches,"

Now when the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus saw him, worn with old age and laden with great grief at heart, he stood still beneath a tall pear tree, and shed tears."

About his dear son he flung both his arms, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus caught him unto him fainting. But when he revived, and his spirit returned again into his breast,"
24,350,354,"ἐξαῦτις μύθοισιν ἀμειβόμενος προσέειπε:

“Father Zeus, verily ye gods yet hold sway on high Olympus, if indeed the wooers have paid the price of their wanton insolence. But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest straightway all the men of Ithaca come hither against us, and"

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Be of good cheer, and let not these things distress thy heart. But let us go to the house, which lies near the orchard, for thither"
24,360,364,"προὔπεμψ᾽,  ὡς ἂν δεῖπνον ἐφοπλίσσωσι τάχιστα.

So spoke the two, and went their way to the goodly house. And when they had come to the stately house, they found Telemachus, and the neatherd, and the swineherd carving flesh in abundance, and mixing the flaming wine."
24,365,369,"τόφρα δὲ Λαέρτην μεγαλήτορα ᾧ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ

But Athena drew near, and made greater the limbs of the shepherd of the people, and made him taller than before and mightier to behold."
24,370,374,"ἐκ δ᾽ ἀσαμίνθου βῆ: θαύμαζε δέ μιν φίλος υἱός,

“Father, surely some one of the gods that are forever has made thee goodlier to behold in comeliness and in stature.”

So they spoke to one another. But when the others had ceased from their labour, and had made ready the meal,"
24,385,389,"ἑξείης ἕζοντο κατὰ κλισμούς τε θρόνους τε:

Then they were about to set hands to their food, when the old man Dolius drew near, and with him the old man's sons, wearied from their work in the fields, for their mother, the old Sicilian woman, had gone forth and called them, she who"
24,390,394,"ἐνδυκέως κομέεσκεν,  ἐπεὶ κατὰ γῆρας ἔμαρψεν.

And they, when they saw Odysseus, and marked him in their minds, stood in the halls lost in wonder. But Odysseus addressed them with gentle words, and said:
“Old man, sit down to dinner, and do ye wholly forget your wonder,"
24,395,399,"δηρὸν γὰρ σίτῳ ἐπιχειρήσειν μεμαῶτες

So he spoke, and Dolius ran straight toward him with both hands outstretched, and he clasped the hand of Odysseus and kissed it on the wrist, and spoke, and addressed him with winged words:

Then Odysseus of many wiles answered him, and said: “Old man, she knows already; why shouldst thou be busied with this?”
So he spoke, and the other sat down again on the polished chair. And even in like manner the sons of Dolius gathered around glorious Odysseus"
24,410,411,"δεικανόωντ᾽ ἐπέεσσι καὶ ἐν χείρεσσι φύοντο,

So they were busied with their meal in the halls; but meanwhile Rumor, the messenger, went swiftly throughout all the city, telling of the terrible death and fate of the wooers."

Forth from the halls they brought each his dead, and buried them; and those from other cities they sent each to his own home, placing them on swift ships for seamen to bear them,"
24,420,424,"αὐτοὶ δ᾽ εἰς ἀγορὴν κίον ἀθρόοι,  ἀχνύμενοι κῆρ.

Now when they were assembled and met together Eupeithes arose and spoke among them, for comfortless grief for his son lay heavy on his heart, even for Antinous, the first man whom goodly Odysseus had slain."
24,425,429,"τοῦ ὅ γε δάκρυ χέων ἀγορήσατο καὶ μετέειπεν:

“Friends, a monstrous deed has this man of a truth devised against the Achaeans. Some he led forth in his ships, many men and goodly, and he has lost his hollow ships and utterly lost his men; and others again has he slain on his return, and these by far the best of the Cephallenians."
24,430,434,"ἀλλ᾽ ἄγετε,  πρὶν τοῦτον ἢ ἐς Πύλον ὦκα ἱκέσθαι

So he spoke, weeping, and pity laid hold of all the Achaeans. Then near them came Medon and the divine minstrel"
24,440,444,"ἐκ μεγάρων Ὀδυσῆος,  ἐπεί σφεας ὕπνος ἀνῆκεν,

“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, for verily not without the will of the immortal gods has Odysseus devised these deeds."
24,445,449,"αὐτὸς ἐγὼν εἶδον θεὸν ἄμβροτον,  ὅς ῥ᾽ Ὀδυσῆϊ

Yet as an immortal god now in front of Odysseus would he appear, heartening him, and now again would rage through the hall, scaring the wooers; and they fell thick and fast.”"
24,450,454,"ὣς φάτο, τοὺς δ᾽ ἄρα πάντας ὑπὸ χλωρὸν δέος ᾕρει.

“Hearken now to me, men of Ithaca, to the word that I shall say."
24,455,459,"ὑμετέρῃ κακότητι,  φίλοι, τάδε ἔργα γένοντο:

They wrought a monstrous deed in their blind and wanton wickedness, wasting the wealth and dishonoring the wife"
24,460,464,"ἀνδρὸς ἀριστῆος: τὸν δ᾽ οὐκέτι φάντο νέεσθαι.

So he spoke, but they sprang up with loud cries, more than half of them, but the rest remained together in their seats;"
24,465,469,"οὐ γὰρ σφιν ἅδε μῦθος ἐνὶ φρεσίν,  ἀλλ᾽ Εὐπείθει

Then when they had clothed their bodies in gleaming bronze, they gathered together in front of the spacious city. And Eupeithes led them in his folly,"
24,470,474,"φῆ δ᾽ ὅ γε τίσεσθαι παιδὸς φόνον,  οὐδ᾽ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλεν

εἰπέ μοι εἰρομένῃ, τί νύ τοι νόος ἔνδοθι κεύθει;","for he thought to avenge the slaying of his son; yet he was himself never more to come back, but was there to meet his doom.
But Athena spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, saying: “Father of us all, thou son of Cronos, high above all lords, tell to me that ask thee what purpose thy mind now hides within thee."
24,475,479,"ἢ προτέρω πόλεμόν τε κακὸν καὶ φύλοπιν αἰνὴν

οὐ γὰρ δὴ τοῦτον μὲν ἐβούλευσας νόον αὐτή,","Wilt thou yet further bring to pass evil war and the dread din of battle, or wilt thou establish friendship betwixt the twain?”
Then Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, answered her, and said: “My child, why dost thou ask and question me of this? Didst thou not thyself devise this plan,"
24,480,484,"ὡς ἦ τοι κείνους Ὀδυσεὺς ἀποτίσεται ἐλθών;

Now that goodly Odysseus has taken vengeance on the wooers, let them swear a solemn oath, and let him be king all his days, and let us on our part"
24,485,489,"ἔκλησιν θέωμεν: τοὶ δ᾽ ἀλλήλους φιλεόντων

οἱ δ᾽ ἐπεὶ οὖν σίτοιο μελίφρονος ἐξ ἔρον ἕντο,","bring about a forgetting of the slaying of their sons and brothers; and let them love one another as before, and let wealth and peace abound.”
So saying, he roused Athena, who was already eager, and she went darting down from the heights of Olympus.
But when they had put from them the desire of honey-hearted food,"
24,490,494,"τοῖς δ᾽ ἄρα μύθων ἦρχε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:

So he spoke, and a son of Dolius went forth, as he bade; he went and stood upon the threshold, and saw them all close at hand, and straightway he spoke to Odysseus winged words:"
24,495,495,οἵδε δὴ ἐγγὺς ἔασ᾽: ἀλλ᾽ ὁπλιζώμεθα θᾶσσον.,"“Here they are close at hand. Quick, let us arm.”"
24,496,499,"ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ὤρνυντο καὶ ἐν τεύχεσσι δύοντο,

So he spoke, and they rose up and arrayed themselves in armour: Odysseus and his men were four, and six the sons of Dolius, and among them Laertes and Dolius donned their armour, grey-headed though they were, warriors perforce."
24,500,504,"αὐτὰρ ἐπεί ῥ᾽ ἕσσαντο περὶ χροῒ νώροπα χαλκόν,

Then Athena, daughter of Zeus, drew near them in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice, and the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus was glad at sight of her,"
24,505,509,"αἶψα δὲ Τηλέμαχον προσεφώνεεν ὃν φίλον υἱόν:

“Telemachus, now shalt thou learn this—having thyself come to the place of battle, where the best warriors are put to the trial—to bring no disgrace upon the house of thy fathers, for we have ever excelled in strength and in valor over all the earth.”
"
24,510,514,"τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:

So said he, and Laertes was glad, and spoke, saying: “What a day is this for me, kind gods!"
24,515,519,"υἱός θ᾽ υἱωνός τ᾽ ἀρετῆς πέρι δῆριν ἔχουσιν.

Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said: “Son of Arceisius, far the dearest of all my friends, make a prayer to the flashing-eyed maiden and to father Zeus, and then straightway raise aloft thy long spear, and hurl it.”
"
24,520,524,"ὣς φάτο, καί ῥ᾽ ἔμπνευσε μένος μέγα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη

τῶν δ᾽ ἄρα δεισάντων ἐκ χειρῶν ἔπτατο τεύχεα,","shouted aloud, and checked all the host, saying:
“Refrain, men of Ithaca, from grievous war, that with all speed you may part, and that without bloodshed.”
So spoke Athena, and pale fear seized them. Then in their terror the arms flew from their hands"
24,535,539,"πάντα δ᾽ ἐπὶ χθονὶ πῖπτε,  θεᾶς ὄπα φωνησάσης:
πρὸς δὲ πόλιν τρωπῶντο λιλαιόμενοι βιότοιο.
σμερδαλέον δ᾽ ἐβόησε πολύτλας δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
οἴμησεν δὲ ἀλεὶς ὥς τ᾽ αἰετὸς ὑψιπετήεις.
καὶ τότε δὴ Κρονίδης ἀφίει ψολόεντα κεραυνόν,","and fell one and all to the ground, as the goddess uttered her voice, and they turned toward the city, eager to save their lives. Terribly then shouted the much-enduring, goodly Odysseus, and gathering himself together he swooped upon them like an eagle of lofty flight, and at that moment the son of Cronos cast a flaming thunderbolt,"
24,540,544,"κὰδ δ᾽ ἔπεσε πρόσθε γλαυκώπιδος ὀβριμοπάτρης.
δὴ τότ᾽ Ὀδυσσῆα προσέφη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
διογενὲς Λαερτιάδη, πολυμήχαν᾽ Ὀδυσσεῦ,
ἴσχεο, παῦε δὲ νεῖκος ὁμοιΐου πολέμοιο,
μή πως τοι Κρονίδης κεχολώσεται εὐρύοπα Ζεύς.","and down it fell before the flashing-eyed daughter of the mighty sire. Then flashing-eyed Athena spoke to Odysseus saying:
“Son of Laertes, sprung from Zeus, Odysseus of many devices, stay thy hand, and make the strife of equal war to cease, lest haply the son of Cronos be wroth with thee, even Zeus, whose voice is borne afar.”
"
24,545,548,"ὣς φάτ᾽ Ἀθηναίη,  ὁ δ᾽ ἐπείθετο, χαῖρε δὲ θυμῷ.
ὅρκια δ᾽ αὖ κατόπισθε μετ᾽ ἀμφοτέροισιν ἔθηκεν
Παλλὰς Ἀθηναίη, κούρη Διὸς αἰγιόχοιο,
Μέντορι εἰδομένη ἠμὲν δέμας ἠδὲ καὶ αὐδήν.","So spoke Athena, and he obeyed, and was glad at heart. Then for all time to come a solemn covenant betwixt the twain was made by Pallas Athena, daughter of Zeus, who bears the aegis, in the likeness of Mentor both in form and in voice."
