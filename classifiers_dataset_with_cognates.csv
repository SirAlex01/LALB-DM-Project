a-de-te-re,3,0,2,0.9,ανδετηρες,"The word 'a-de-te-re' has the Greek cognate 'ανδετηρες', which means 'binders'. This suggests that 'a-de-te-re' is a common noun.

The lexicon entry indicates '(decorated) with men'. Considering these cognates and the meaning, it is likely a common noun. The ending '-pi' could be an instrumental/locative suffix, so we consider 'a-di-ri-ja'. The cognates suggest a connection to 'ανηρ' (man), which is an athematic noun. Therefore, I classify it as a common noun with athematic inflection."
a-di-ri-ja-te,3,2,1,0.9,ανδριαντει,"The word 'a-di-ri-ja-te' has the cognate 'ανδριαντει'. The Linear B word ends in '-te', which is an ablative suffix and should be ignored. The remaining part 'a-di-ri-ja' corresponds to the Greek word 'ανδριας' (statue, image of a man). The cognate 'ανδριαντει' is the dative plural of 'ανδριας', meaning 'for/to statues'. Therefore, 'a-di-ri-ja' is likely an adjective in the dative plural form, describing something related to statues or images of men. Since it's an adjective, it's classified as part_of_speech 2. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic inflection in -a."
a-di-ri-jo,3,2,2,0.9,ανδριος|ανηρ,"The word 'a-di-ri-jo' has Greek cognates 'ανδριος' and 'ανηρ'.

The Linear B word likely represents a personal name or a name derived from the concept of 'man'. The ending '-jo' doesn't directly correspond to a thematic -o declension. However, considering the cognate 'ανηρ', which is an athematic noun, and the possibility of the Linear B word being a derivative or a related form, it's more likely to be an athematic noun. The -jo ending could be a modified genitive or another case form. Therefore, I classify it as an anthroponym (0), a noun (0), and athematic (2)."

The ending '-ne' doesn't directly correspond to any thematic inflection. However, considering the cognates and the lexicon entry, it's likely an athematic noun. The ending -ne could be a variation of the athematic dative/locative ending -e/-i, or a different case ending altogether. Given the uncertainty, but the strong evidence for a place name, I classify it as athematic."

'δορπευς' is a masculine noun. The Linear B word ends in '-ja', which corresponds to the '-a' suffix in the declension table for thematic nouns in -a.

do-ra-qe,3,0,0,0.95,δωρον|δωρα,"The word 'do-ra-qe' can be broken down into 'do-ra' and '-qe'. '-qe' is a conjunction suffix and can be ignored. 'do-ra' has the cognates δωρον/δωρα, meaning 'gift/gifts'. The Linear B word 'do-ra' corresponds to the plural form δωρα, which is a common noun. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun in -a, but the provided declension table shows that the plural nominative/accusative neuter form of thematic nouns in -o also ends in -a. However, the cognate δωρα is plural, so it is more likely that 'do-ra' is a thematic noun in -o (neuter plural) or a thematic noun in -a (feminine plural). Since the lexicon entry states 'gifts', and the cognate is δωρα, I classify it as a thematic noun in -o (neuter plural). Therefore, the inflection is 0."

The ending '-wa' does not fit the thematic -o or -a declensions. Given the cognate and the absence of a clear thematic ending, it is classified as an athematic noun. The ancient greek cognate is a neuter term, and the linear b term is likely to be a neuter term as well. The athematic neuter terms have a variable nominative/accusative, and the -a ending is compatible with this declension."
do-we-jo,3,2,0,0.95,δορfειος|δορφειος,"The word 'do-we-jo' has cognates 'δορfειος/δορφειος' meaning 'wooden' or 'made of wood'. This indicates it is an adjective.

du-ni-jo-jo,0,0,0,0.95,δυνιοιο|δυνιος,"The word 'du-ni-jo-jo' has the cognates 'δυνιοιο' and 'δυνιος'. The lexicon indicates it's a personal name.

du-wo-u-pi,3,2,0,0.9,δυfουπι|δυο,"The word 'du-wo-u-pi' has the suffix '-pi', which should be ignored. The remaining part 'du-wo-u' has the cognate 'δυfουπι|δυο', which means 'two'.

The ending '-jo' suggests a thematic noun in -o, possibly a diminutive or a patronymic form. The lexicon entry 'two' from Tselentis is likely a misunderstanding or a different interpretation of the word's root. Given the anthroponym classification by Chadwick & Ventris and the thematic -o ending, it's classified as an anthroponym (word_type = 0), a noun (part_of_speech = 0), and thematic in -o (inflection = 0)."
e-da-e-u,0,0,2,0.9,εδαευς,"The word 'e-da-e-u' has the cognate 'εδαευς'. The lexicon 'personal name' suggests it is an anthroponym. The ending '-u' suggests an athematic inflection, similar to 'agreus' and 'khalkeus'."

The ending '-te' is not a standard thematic ending. The cognate 'εγματει' suggests a possible athematic inflection. The lexicon entries 'with support' and 'stay' do not provide definitive clues about the word type, but they suggest a common word. Therefore, I classify it as a common noun with athematic inflection."
e-ka-ma-te-qe,3,2,1,0.9,εκαμαθε,"The word 'e-ka-ma-te-qe' has the cognate 'εκαμαθε'. Removing the suffix '-qe', we have 'e-ka-ma-te'. The cognate 'εκαμαθε' suggests a participle form, specifically a passive participle. The ending '-te' could be a syllabic representation of a suffix related to participles. Given the cognate, it is likely a participle, and thus an adjective. The ending can be related to the -a declension, so inflection is 1."

The cognate 'γραω' suggests a connection to the act of eating or grazing, which is consistent with the description of rams. The ending -we is likely a variant of the athematic ending.

The Linear B word 'e-u-me-de' is likely the dative form of the name, as suggested by Chadwick & Ventris. The ending '-de' is a suffix that can be allative/demonstrative, but in this case, given the cognate and the lexicon entries, it is part of the name itself. The ancient greek cognate 'ευμεδης' is an athematic noun, and the linear B word is classified as athematic (inflection = 2)."
e-u-me-de-i,0,0,2,0.95,ευμηδης,"The word 'e-u-me-de-i' has the cognate 'ευμηδης', which is a personal name (anthroponym). The Linear B word likely represents a form of this name.

e-wi-su-zo-ko,3,0,2,0.75,εfισυζορκος,"The word 'e-wi-su-zo-ko' has the cognate 'εfισυζορκος'. According to the lexicon, it means 'decorative motif ('with deer οη both sides?')

i-su-ku-wo-do-to,0,0,2,0.9,ισυχυfδοτος,"The word 'i-su-ku-wo-do-to' has the cognate 'ισυχυfδοτος', which is likely a personal name. The ending '-to' suggests an athematic inflection, as thematic nouns in -o typically have a simpler -o ending in the nominative singular. The lexicon also indicates it's a personal name. Therefore, it's classified as an anthroponym (word_type=0), a noun (part_of_speech=0), and athematic (inflection=2)."
i-te-ja-o,3,0,0,0.85,ιθειαι|ιθειαων|ιθευς|ιθυνω,"The word 'i-te-ja-o' has cognates like 'ιθειαι', 'ιθειαων', 'ιθευς', 'ιθυνω'. The lexicon entry suggests 'weavers' related to 'ιθύνω' (to make straight). The ending '-o' suggests a thematic noun in -o, possibly a genitive singular or nominative/accusative plural neuter form. Given the connection to weaving and 'ιθυνω', it's likely a common noun. The cognates 'ιθειαι' and 'ιθειαων' are related to 'straight' or 'true', so 'i-te-ja-o' could be related to tools or processes used in weaving, hence a common noun."
i-te-u,0,0,2,0.9,ιθυς,"The word 'i-te-u' has the cognate 'ιθυς', which means 'straight, upright'. The lexicon entry 'weavers (&gt;ιθύνω= to make straight)' suggests a connection to the verb 'ιθύνω' (to make straight). However, Chadwick & Ventris identify it as an anthroponym. Given the -u ending and the cognate, it is likely an athematic noun (anthroponym) in the nominative case. The -u ending is characteristic of athematic nouns. Therefore, word_type is anthroponym (0), part_of_speech is noun (0), and inflection is athematic (2)."

jo-qi,3,0,2,0.95,οτι|οςτις,"The Linear B word 'jo-qi' has the Greek cognates 'οτι' and 'οςτις'. 'οτι' means 'that' or 'because', and 'οςτις' means 'whoever' or 'whichever'. Both are pronouns/relative pronouns. Since Linear B is syllabic, the ending -qi could represent a variety of athematic inflections. Given the cognates, it is likely an athematic form. Therefore, it is classified as a common word (pronoun), part of speech is noun, and inflection is athematic."
ka,3,0,1,0.8,και,"The word 'ka' has the cognate 'και' (kai), which means 'and'. It is a conjunction, but in Linear B, single-syllable words are often nouns. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun in -a."

The ending '-to' suggests it could be a thematic noun in -o, but given the lack of clear thematic declension in the cognate and the possibility of athematic declension, and considering the anthroponym classification, it's more likely an athematic noun. The ancient greek cognate does not help in this case, so we assume it is an athematic noun."
ka-da-mi-ja,3,0,1,0.95,καρδαμια|καρδαμον,"The word 'ka-da-mi-ja' has the Greek cognates 'καρδαμια' and 'καρδαμον', suggesting it refers to a type of spice, specifically garden cress.

ka-di-ti-ja,2,0,1,0.95,καδιστια,"The word 'ka-di-ti-ja' has the Greek cognate 'καδιστια'. Chadwick & Ventris suggest it might be a feminine ethnic name. Ruijgh suggests it's a toponym in -ία. Given the -ja ending, which corresponds to the -ια in the Greek cognate, and the lexicon entries, it is most likely an ethnonym or toponym. The -ja ending aligns with the thematic -a inflection class. Therefore, I classify it as an ethnonym (word_type = 4), a noun (part_of_speech = 0), with thematic -a inflection (inflection = 1)."
ka-e-sa-me-no,0,2,0,0.9,καεσαμενος,"The word 'ka-e-sa-me-no' has the Greek cognate 'καεσαμενος'. The lexicon entries suggest it's an anthroponym.

ka-ka,3,0,0,0.7,κακοω,"The word 'ka-ka' has a cognate κακοω. Chadwick & Ventris suggest a connection to 'spears with bronze points'. The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun. Given the context of administrative records, it's likely a common noun.

ka-ke-ja,3,2,1,0.9,χαλκια,"The word 'ka-ke-ja' has the cognate 'χαλκια' (chalkia), which means 'made of copper' or 'bronze objects'. This suggests that 'ka-ke-ja' is an adjective describing something made of copper or bronze.

The remaining part 'ka-ke-ja' corresponds to 'χαλκεα', which is the neuter plural form of the adjective 'χαλκεος' (bronze). Therefore, 'ka-ke-ja' is a common word, specifically an adjective used substantively as a noun (things of bronze). The ending '-ja' suggests an athematic inflection, as thematic neuter plural nouns end in '-a' (e.g., 'do-ra' for 'δωρα')."

The ending '-ja' suggests that it is an adjective in the feminine form, derived from a noun related to copper. Therefore, it is classified as a common adjective, thematic in -a, describing something made of copper. The greek cognates are adjectives, so the part of speech is adjective. The ending -ja corresponds to the -α ending of the feminine form of adjectives in ancient greek, so the inflection is 1."

The remaining part 'ka-ra-a' could be related to 'κάρη' or 'κράατος', both meaning 'head'. Given the athematic nature of 'κράατος' (genitive form), and the lack of clear thematic endings, I classify 'ka-ra-a-pi' as an athematic noun (inflection 2). It is a common word referring to 'head'."

The cognates βληχων and γλαχων suggest an athematic inflection, as the ending -ων is typical of athematic nouns in ancient Greek. The Linear B word ends in -ko, which could be a syllabic representation of a stem ending in a consonant followed by -o. Given the cognates, it's more likely that the original word was athematic, and the -o is a result of syllabification in Linear B. Therefore, I classify it as athematic."
ka-ra-ma-to,3,0,2,0.9,κλασμα|κλασματος,"The word 'ka-ra-ma-to' has cognates 'κλασμα' and 'κλασματος', meaning 'fragment'. The Linear B word likely represents a noun.

The suffix '-de' is an allative/demonstrative suffix and should be ignored for classification. The remaining part 'me-ta-pa' does not clearly indicate a thematic inflection in -o or -a. However, given the lack of clear thematic ending and the possibility of an athematic stem, I classify it as athematic (inflection 2). The ancient greek cognate does not help in determining the inflection."
me-ta-pi-jo,2,0,0,0.95,μεταπιος,"The word 'me-ta-pi-jo' has the Greek cognate 'μεταπιος', and the lexicon entry indicates it's an ethnic name of 'Metapa'.

o-di-do-si,3,1,-1,0.95,διδωσι,"The word 'o-di-do-si' has the cognate 'διδωσι', which means 'he/she/it gives'. The '-si' ending is a clear indicator of a 3rd person singular verb in Mycenaean Greek.

The ending '-we' doesn't directly correspond to a thematic -o or -a ending. However, considering the cognate 'οδρυς', which is an athematic noun, and the fact that Linear B is syllabic, the '-we' could represent a modified form of an athematic ending. Therefore, I classify it as an athematic noun (inflection 2) and a toponym (word_type 3)."

Since it's an adverb, inflection is not applicable."

o-nu,3,0,2,0.9,ονυξ,"The word 'o-nu' has the cognate 'ονυξ' (onyx/nail). Chadwick & Ventris suggest it's a variant spelling of 'o-nu-ka', associated with wool.

pa-te-ko-to,3,0,2,0.95,παντεκτων,"The word 'pa-te-ko-to' has the cognate 'παντεκτων' (pantekton), meaning 'all-builder'. This suggests it is a common noun.

po-ru-po-de,0,0,0,0.95,πολυποδει|πολυπους,"The word 'po-ru-po-de' has the Greek cognates 'πολυποδει' and 'πολυπους', both referring to an octopus. The Linear B word likely represents a form of the word for 'octopus'. The suffix '-de' can be ignored. The remaining part 'po-ru-po' can be interpreted as a thematic noun in -o, referring to an animal. The cognates confirm that it is an animal name."
po-ru-po-de-qe,3,0,2,0.9,πολυπους,"The word is 'po-ru-po-de-qe'. Removing the suffix '-qe', we have 'po-ru-po-de'. The cognate is 'πολυπους' (polypous), meaning 'octopus'. This is a common noun. The ending '-de' is not a standard thematic ending. The ancient greek cognate is an athematic noun, so the linear B word is classified as athematic."
po-ru-qo-ta,0,0,0,0.95,πολυβοτας,"The word 'po-ru-qo-ta' has the Greek cognate 'πολυβοτας', which is a personal name (anthroponym) meaning 'rich in cattle'. The Linear B word ends in '-ta', which corresponds to the thematic inflection in -a (nominative singular) after removing the final consonant. Therefore, it is classified as an anthroponym, a noun, and thematic in -o (because the cognate ends in -as, which is a thematic noun in -o in the nominative singular)."
po-se-da-o,0,0,0,0.95,ποσειδαονει|ποσειδαων|ποσειδων,"The word 'po-se-da-o' has Greek cognates Ποσειδαονει, Ποσειδαων, and Ποσειδων, all related to Poseidon. The lexicon entries also confirm it's a theonym (deity name). The word ends in '-o', suggesting a thematic noun in -o. The cognates suggest that it could be a nominative or dative form. Given the lexicon entries mentioning dative and genitive forms, and the fact that the nominative form of Poseidon is Ποσειδων, I classify it as a thematic noun in -o, likely a nominative or dative form of Poseidon."
po-se-da-o-ne,0,0,2,0.95,ποσειδαων|ποσειδονι,"The word 'po-se-da-o-ne' has the Greek cognates 'ποσειδαων' and 'ποσειδονι', which are forms of Poseidon's name. The lexicon entry confirms it's a god's name. The ending '-ne' corresponds to the athematic dative singular inflection, as seen in the cognate 'ποσειδονι'. Therefore, it's a theonym (deity name), a noun, and athematic."
po-se-da-o-ni,0,0,2,0.95,ποσειδαων|ποσειδαοι|ποσειδαος|ποσειδονι,"The word 'po-se-da-o-ni' has Greek cognates related to Poseidon (ποσειδαων, ποσειδαοι, ποσειδαος, ποσειδονι), indicating it's a theonym (deity name).

po-se-da-o-no,0,0,0,0.95,ποσειδαων,"The word 'po-se-da-o-no' has the cognate 'ποσειδαων', which refers to Poseidon, a deity. Therefore, the word type is 'theonym'. The Linear B word ends in '-o', suggesting a thematic noun in -o. The cognate ποσειδαων is a noun, so the part of speech is noun."
po-si,3,3,-1,0.7,ποσι,"The word 'po-si' has the cognate 'ποσι', which means 'up/on' according to the lexicon. This suggests that 'po-si' is an adverb indicating location or direction. Therefore, the part of speech is adverb (3), and inflection is not applicable (-1) for adverbs."
po-si-da-e-ja,0,0,1,0.95,ποσιδαεια|ποσιδαιεια,"The word 'po-si-da-e-ja' has the Greek cognates 'ποσιδαεια/ποσιδαιεια', which refer to Poseidaia, a place associated with Poseidon, or a festival of Poseidon. Given the lexicon entry 'goddess' s name', it is most likely a theonym (deity name). The ending '-a' suggests a thematic noun in -a."
po-si-da-e-we,0,0,2,0.95,ποσιδαεfες,"The word 'po-si-da-e-we' has the cognate 'ποσιδαεfες', which is related to Poseidon. The lexicon entry confirms it's a cult association related to Poseidon, making it a theonym. The ending '-we' suggests an athematic inflection, possibly a dative form similar to 'di-we' (Zeus, dative). Therefore, it's classified as a theonym (2), noun (0), and athematic (2)."

po-si-da-i-je-u-si,0,0,2,0.9,ποσιδαιευς|ποσιδαιερευς|ποσιδαιγευς,"The word 'po-si-da-i-je-u-si' has cognates 'ποσιδαιευς', 'ποσιδαιερευς', and 'ποσιδαιγευς', which refer to persons associated with Poseidon. The lexicon entries also suggest a priestly role related to Poseidon. The ending '-u-si' corresponds to the athematic plural dative/locative ending '-si' or '-ti' (as seen in the declension table), but the cognates suggest a nominative plural form. The cognates end in -ευς, -ερευς, and -γευς, which are typical of athematic nouns. Therefore, it's likely an anthroponym (person name) in the nominative plural, and athematic."
po-si-da-i-jo,0,0,0,0.95,ποσιδαιον,"The word 'po-si-da-i-jo' has the cognate 'ποσιδαιον', which refers to a place or temple dedicated to Poseidon. This indicates it's a theonym related to Poseidon. The ending '-jo' suggests a thematic noun in -o, likely a neuter form referring to the temple itself. Therefore, it's classified as a theonym (2), noun (0), and thematic in -o (0)."
po-si-da-i-jo-de,0,0,0,0.95,ποσιδαιον,"The word 'po-si-da-i-jo-de' has the cognate 'ποσιδαιον', which refers to a place dedicated to Poseidon. The suffix '-de' is an allative/demonstrative suffix, so we consider 'po-si-da-i-jo'. The cognate suggests that it is a theonym (place dedicated to a deity). The ending '-jo' suggests a thematic noun in -o, specifically a genitive form. Therefore, it's a thematic noun in -o."
po-si-ke-te-re,3,0,2,0.9,οικετης|ικετης|ποσικετερες,"The word 'po-si-ke-te-re' has cognates like οικετης, ικετης, and ποσικετερες, suggesting a meaning related to 'dweller,' 'suppliant,' or 'immigrant.' The ending '-re' suggests an athematic inflection. Given the cognates and lexicon entries, it's likely a common noun. The cognate ποσικετερες is a plural form, and the Linear B word could be related to that. The ending -re is not a standard thematic ending, so it is classified as athematic."
po-so-pe-re-i,0,0,2,0.9,ψωφρει|ψωφρης,"The word 'po-so-pe-re-i' has cognates ψωφρει and ψωφρης, which are personal names. The lexicon also indicates it's an anthroponym. The ending '-i' suggests a dative form, which is common for personal names in Linear B. The cognates suggest an athematic declension, as there is no clear thematic vowel. Therefore, it's classified as an anthroponym (word_type=0), a noun (part_of_speech=0), and athematic (inflection=2)."
po-so-ra-ko,0,0,2,0.9,ψωρακος,"The word 'po-so-ra-ko' has the Greek cognate 'ψωρακος'. According to Chadwick and Ventris, it means 'man responsible for the metal melting furnace', while Tselentis suggests it's a personal name. Given the cognate and the lexicon entries, it's likely an anthroponym (person name). The ending '-ko' doesn't directly correspond to a thematic -o noun ending, nor to a thematic -a noun ending. However, the cognate ψωρακος suggests an athematic declension. Therefore, I classify it as an athematic noun."
po-so-re-ja,3,0,1,0.7,ψωρεια|καπνος,"The word 'po-so-re-ja' has two possible cognates: 'ψωρεια' (psoreia) and 'καπνος' (kapnos). 'ψωρεια' refers to a skin disease, while 'καπνος' means smoke. The lexicon entry 'smoke' from Chadwick-Ventris supports the 'καπνος' cognate. However, the ending '-ja' suggests a thematic noun in -a, which is not consistent with 'καπνος' (thematic in -o). The Tselentis lexicon suggests a personal name, but without further evidence, I will classify it as a common noun, possibly related to a skin condition or smoke, and inflected as a thematic noun in -a, based on the ending. The cognate 'ψωρεια' is more likely, and it is a thematic noun in -a."
po-so-ro,0,0,0,0.9,ψωρος,"The word 'po-so-ro' has the Greek cognate 'ψωρος', and the lexicon indicates it's a personal name. The ending '-o' suggests it's a thematic noun in -o."
po-te-wo,0,0,2,0.9,ποντευς,"The word 'po-te-wo' has the cognate 'ποντευς' (ponteus). Ponteus is a personal name (anthroponym) meaning 'seafarer' or 'one who belongs to the sea'. The ending '-eus' suggests an athematic noun declension, as it doesn't follow the typical -o or -a thematic patterns. Therefore, it's classified as an anthroponym, a noun, and athematic."
po-ti-jo,0,0,0,0.95,ποντιος,"The word 'po-ti-jo' has the Greek cognate 'ποντιος' (pontios). Chadwick & Ventris identify it as an anthroponym. The -o ending suggests it's a thematic noun in -o, likely a masculine nominative singular form.

po-ti-ni-ja-i-qe-a,0,0,1,0.95,ποτνειαιππεια,"The word is 'po-ti-ni-ja-i-qe-a'. After removing the suffixes '-qe' and '-a', we are left with 'po-ti-ni-ja-i'. The cognate is 'ποτνειαιππεια'. The first part of the cognate is 'ποτνεια', which is related to 'Potnia', a title for female deities. The suffix '-i' suggests a dative plural form. Therefore, the word is a theonym (deity name), a noun, and has a thematic inflection in -a, as the base word 'po-ti-ni-ja' (Potnia) is thematic in -a. The final -a is likely a case ending, possibly nominative/accusative plural or genitive singular, but the dative plural -i is more likely given the cognate."
po-ti-ni-ja-we,0,0,1,0.95,ποτνια,"The word 'po-ti-ni-ja-we' has the cognate 'ποτνια'. 'ποτνια' means 'mistress, lady, female deity title'.

po-ti-pi,3,0,2,0.75,πορτις|πορτιφι,"The word 'po-ti-pi' has cognates 'πορτις' and 'πορτιφι'. The lexicon entry suggests '(decorated with a) young cow'. 'πορτις' means 'young cow'.

po-ti-pi-qe,3,0,2,0.9,πορτις,"The word is 'po-ti-pi-qe'. Removing the suffix '-qe', we have 'po-ti-pi'. The cognate is 'πορτις'. This suggests the word is a common noun. The ending '-pi' does not match the thematic declensions in -o or -a. Therefore, it is classified as athematic."

The cognate 'πτερνη' (heel) suggests a connection to the foot. The ending '-no' is not a standard thematic ending (-o or -a). The cognate 'στενοι' (narrow) could suggest an athematic inflection, as the nominative plural ends in -e/-oi in thematic declensions, and -e in athematic declensions. Given the cognates and the lack of clear thematic ending, I classify it as athematic."
pte-re-wa,3,0,1,0.95,πτελεfα|πτελεα|πτελεfας,"The word 'pte-re-wa' has Greek cognates 'πτελεfα', 'πτελεα', 'πτελεfας', all related to 'elm tree'. The Linear B word likely represents a noun.
