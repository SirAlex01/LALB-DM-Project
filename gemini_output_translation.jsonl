The mapping of 'ja' to 'ια' (j → ι, a → α) and 'ro' to 'λο' (r → λ, o → ο) exhibits high distributional similarity, consistent with documented patterns. The primary uncertainty stems from the unknown syllabogram '*22'. Assuming '*22' represents a simple 'α' (as is often hypothesized for the syllabogram a₃, which may lose a subsequent yod or aspiration), the overall distributional similarity becomes acceptable.\n2.  **Monotonic Character Mapping (Principle 2):** High. The relative ordering of phonemes is strictly preserved, with 'α-ια-λο' directly reflecting the sequence '*22-ja-ro'. No reordering of characters is required.\n3.  **Structural Sparsity (Principle 3):** High. The mapping is largely one-to-one for known syllabograms (ja → ια, ro → λο). The interpretation of '*22' as 'α' is the most sparse and direct mapping for an unknown syllabogram if its underlying phonetic value contained an 'a' vowel. If '*22' originally represented 'aj' or 'aʰ', the loss of a single 'j' or 'h' is not considered the 'deletion of multiple phonemes' according to Factor 1 of the downweighting rules, thus maintaining high sparsity.\n4.  **Significant Cognate Overlap (Principle 4):** High. The correspondences 'j' → 'ι' and 'r' → 'λ' are well-documented and reinforce systematic patterns observed between Linear B and Ancient Greek. The stability of vowels 'a' and 'o' is also consistent with established patterns.\n\n**Likelihood Justification:**\n*   The presence of the unknown syllabogram '*22' triggers a significant reduction in likelihood, with a hard cap at less than 0.7 (Factor 3). This is a non-negotiable rule. Therefore, the base likelihood starts at 0.69.\n*   No further reduction by Factor 1 (three or more non-trivial sound transformations, reordering of phonemes, or addition/deletion of multiple phonemes) is applied, as the proposed mapping is largely one-to-one and simple for the known syllabograms, and the interpretation of '*22' as 'α' represents the most parsimonious phonological change (e.g., loss of a single element like 'j' or 'h' from an underlying 'aj' or 'aʰ').\n*   No reduction by Factor 2 (rarity, conflict with scholarship, semantic stretching) is applied, as 'αιαλος' is a known Ancient Greek word (related to 'αιγιαλός' meaning 'sea-coast, shore'), and its use as an anthroponym (e.g., 'man from the shore') is plausible.\n*   The final likelihood of 0.65 reflects good evidence for the known parts of the Linear B word and a plausible, parsimonious interpretation for the unknown syllabogram, while strictly adhering to the maximum likelihood cap imposed by the presence of '*22'.\n\n**Uncertainties and Alternative Explanations:**\n*   The primary uncertainty remains the precise phonetic value of '*22'. While the interpretation as 'α' is the most sparse, it is an inference. Alternative interpretations for '*22', such as representing a consonant cluster (e.g., 'αν' or 'αγ'), would lead to less sparse mappings (1-to-2 transformations). For example, mapping '*22' to 'αν' for 'ανιαρος' or to 'αγ' for 'αγιαλος' would incur a 0.3 reduction (Factor 1), resulting in a much lower likelihood (0.39), placing them in the 'highly speculative' category.

This principle is respected.\n3.  **Principle 3 (Structural Sparsity):** This principle is significantly strained. The mapping of the single unknown Linear B syllabogram *22 to two Ancient Greek phonemes (αγ) constitutes a one-to-two mapping, violating structural sparsity. The transformation of 'je' to 'η' involves the loss of 'j', which, while a documented phonological process, also reduces strict one-to-one mapping. The 'mi' to 'μι' mapping is one-to-one and sparse.\n4.  **Principle 4 (Cognate Overlap):** There is no documented or systematic correspondence pattern for *22. Thus, the mapping for *22 -> αγ does not reinforce established patterns.

The analysis is as follows:\n\n1.  **Mapping of Syllabograms:**\n    *   `da` -> `δα`: This is a robust and direct correspondence. 'd' maps to 'δ' (phonological mapping entry 6), and 'a' maps to 'α' (vowel_a: generally stable). This is a perfect one-to-one mapping.\n    *   `de` -> `δε`: This is also a robust and direct correspondence. 'd' maps to 'δ' (phonological mapping entry 6), and 'e' maps to 'ε' (vowel_e: typically corresponds to ε). This is a perfect one-to-one mapping.\n    *   `*47` -> `ου`: This is the most speculative part due to '*47' being an unknown syllabogram. We hypothesize it represents an 'ou' diphthong. While 'o-u' is typically written as two syllabograms (e.g., `qo-u`), it is plausible for an unknown, potentially complex, single syllabogram to represent a diphthong. This is a necessary assumption to reconstruct a meaningful Greek word.\n\n2.  **Principle 1 (Distributional Similarity):** The correspondences `da` -> `δα` and `de` -> `δε` exhibit high distributional similarity, appearing in consistent phonetic environments. For `*47` -> `ου`, distributional similarity cannot be rigorously assessed due to the unknown nature of `*47`, thus introducing uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Principle 2 (Monotonic Character Mapping):** The relative ordering of phonemes is strictly preserved in the transformation. There are no reorderings of sounds, and the proposed mapping maintains the sequence of parts.\n\n4.  **Principle 3 (Structural Sparsity of Cognate Mapping):** The mappings for `da` and `de` are one-to-one, upholding high sparsity. The mapping of `*47` to `ου` (a single syllabogram to a diphthong) is considered reasonably sparse, as diphthongs function as single phonetic units and avoid unjustified many-to-many correspondences or multiple insertions/deletions.\n\n5.  **Principle 4 (Significant Cognate Overlap Within Related Languages):** The `da-de` -> `δαδε` transformation aligns perfectly with documented patterns for Linear B syllabograms and common Ancient Greek directional suffixes (`-δε`). The resulting word 'ουδαδε' ('nowhere') is a well-attested Ancient Greek adverb of place, reinforcing a systematic pattern.\n\n**Uncertainties and Likelihood:** The primary uncertainty stems from the unknown phonetic value of the syllabogram `*47`. Any specific phonetic assignment to it remains a hypothesis. As per the automatic downweighting factor 3, the presence of an unknown syllabogram `*47` necessitates a reduction in likelihood by 0.4 and a hard cap below 0.7. Starting from an estimated base likelihood of 0.85 (for the strong `da-de` match and semantic plausibility), the reduction yields a final likelihood of 0.85 - 0.4 = 0.45. This places the proposal in the 'Plausible connection with significant uncertainties' category, reflecting the strong support for the 'da-de' portion combined with the unavoidable speculation for `*47`."}]}}

This significantly reduces structural sparsity and is the primary reason for a lower score on this principle.\n- The mapping of `wo` to `fo` is sparser (1:1 for consonant and vowel).

The highest possible starting point is therefore 0.69.\n2.  **Reduction for Non-Sparse Mapping (Factor 1):** The mapping of `*49` to `αγλα` involves one Linear B syllabogram corresponding to four Ancient Greek phonemes. This constitutes 'addition/deletion of multiple phonemes' and 'three or more non-trivial sound transformations' from a standard C+V syllabogram interpretation. This requires a reduction of 0.3 from the likelihood.\n3.  **Final Likelihood:** 0.69 (initial capped likelihood) - 0.3 (sparsity penalty) = 0.39.\n\nThis likelihood score places the cognate in the 'Plausible connection with significant uncertainties' category, strictly reflecting the application of the defined rules for unknown syllabograms and structural sparsity, even for a cognate potentially well-attested in scholarly literature."}]}}

This word exists in Ancient Greek (though not commonly used for 'untamed', but 'not partaking in fast'). The semantic fit is plausible.\n\n**Likelihood Calculation:** This is a strong, novel cognate proposal that rigorously adheres to all principles and documented patterns. It avoids the inconsistencies present in the system's `proposed_cognates` list. The single non-trivial transformation (dummy vowel deletion) is justified by analogous examples, preventing a significant likelihood reduction.

This mapping observes the following principles:\n\nPrinciple 1 (Distributional Similarity): The initial 'a' maps to 'α'. The sequence 'ka-ta' represents the consonant cluster 'κτ', a common feature in Mycenaean where the vowels of medial syllabograms are elided or assimilated in consonant clusters. The 'jo' syllabogram, representing a yod, commonly corresponds to the suffix 'ιος' or 'αιος' in Greek, thus 'ta-jo' plausibly corresponds to 'ταιος' with the 'a' of 'ta' combining with 'j' to form the 'αι' diphthong. The 'o' of 'jo' becomes the omicron in the nominative suffix 'ος'. This distributional pattern is consistent.\n\nPrinciple 2 (Monotonic Character Mapping): The relative ordering of phonemes (a-k-t-j-o) is preserved in 'α-κ-τ-αι-ος'. The transformations, such as vowel elision in the 'ka-ta' sequence for the 'κτ' cluster and diphthong formation (a+j > αι) within the suffix, are systematic and follow documented Mycenaean phonetic rules, not requiring any reordering.\n\nPrinciple 3 (Structural Sparsity): The mapping is largely one-to-one for the individual phonemic components. While 'ka-ta' maps to 'κτ' and 'ta-jo' maps to 'ταιος', these are not arbitrary many-to-many mappings but rather standard phonological processes for representing consonant clusters and nominal suffixes in Linear B. The addition of final 'ς' is a regular nominative singular ending.\n\nPrinciple 4 (Significant Cognate Overlap): 'ακταιος' is a well-attested Ancient Greek word, serving as an adjective meaning 'coastal' or 'of the shore', and also as a proper name (anthroponym), which aligns perfectly with the definition of 'a-ka-ta-jo'. The phonological patterns (cluster representation, suffix formation) are consistent with established correspondences between Linear B and Ancient Greek. This correspondence is widely accepted in scholarly literature.\n\nUncertainty Check: The connection is very strong, and 'ακταιος' is the most direct and well-supported cognate.
